# **Layered Tasks in Communication**

## **Understanding Layers in Daily Life**
We use the concept of **layers** in our **daily life**. A good example is sending a **letter via postal mail**. The process involves different tasks, similar to **network communication layers**.

### **Example: Sending a Letter**
The **process of sending a letter** involves multiple steps, as shown below:

### **At the Sender’s Side**
1. **Higher Layer**  
   - The sender writes the letter.  
   - Inserts it into an envelope.  
   - Writes sender and receiver addresses.  
   - Drops the letter in a mailbox.

2. **Middle Layer**  
   - A mail carrier picks up the letter.  
   - Delivers it to the post office.

3. **Lower Layer**  
   - The post office sorts the letter.  
   - A transport carrier (truck, train, airplane, etc.) takes it to the recipient's location.

### **During Transmission**
- The letter is **transported** through different routes.  
- It may **pass through a central processing office**.  
- It is handled by various **transport mediums** (e.g., trucks, planes, boats).

### **At the Receiver’s Side**
1. **Lower Layer**  
   - The letter is **transported** to the recipient’s local post office.

2. **Middle Layer**  
   - The post office **sorts** the letter.  
   - A mail carrier **delivers** it to the recipient's mailbox.

3. **Higher Layer**  
   - The recipient **retrieves** the letter.  
   - **Opens the envelope**.  
   - **Reads the message**.

### **Comparison with Network Layers**
This example closely resembles **network communication**:
- **Higher Layers** → Handle user **data creation and interpretation**.
- **Middle Layers** → Manage **data transfer and routing**.
- **Lower Layers** → Handle **physical transmission of data**.

Layered models help **simplify communication** by dividing tasks into **manageable steps**.

# **The OSI Model**

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** is a conceptual framework used to understand and design network communication systems. It is not a protocol but a model that facilitates communication between different systems without altering their underlying hardware or software. The OSI model consists of **seven layers**, each representing different tasks and functions involved in moving information across a network.

## **Purpose of the OSI Model**
The OSI model provides a standard for different systems to communicate, ensuring **interoperability** across networks, regardless of the underlying technologies or architectures. The OSI model helps to break down complex communication tasks into smaller, manageable layers.

## **Seven Layers of the OSI Model**
The OSI model is structured as follows:

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
   - Deals with the transmission of raw data bits over a physical medium (e.g., cables, radio waves).

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
   - Responsible for reliable data transfer between two directly connected nodes, including error detection and correction.

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
   - Handles routing and forwarding of data packets across networks, and manages logical addressing (IP addressing).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**  
   - Ensures reliable data transfer between end systems, providing flow control, error control, and segmentation/reassembly of data.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**  
   - Manages sessions, controls dialog between devices, and synchronizes communication.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**  
   - Translates data into a format that the application layer can understand, including encryption, compression, and data encoding.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**  
   - The closest layer to the user, facilitating end-user services like email, file transfer, and web browsing.

## **Layered Architecture**
- **Sending Process:**
  As data is transmitted from **Device A** to **Device B**, it passes through the seven layers in a **downward** direction on the sending device, and a **upward** direction on the receiving device.

- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:**
  At each layer, data is passed down from the **sending layer** to the **receiving layer**, and each layer is responsible for handling its specific tasks. The communication at each layer follows specific **protocols** that define how data is formatted, interpreted, and transmitted.

## **Encapsulation**
- As data moves down through the layers of the OSI model, it is **encapsulated** within a header (and sometimes a trailer) at each layer.
- For example, data at Layer 7 (Application Layer) is encapsulated into Layer 6 (Presentation Layer), and this process continues down to the Physical Layer.
- When the data reaches its destination, it travels up through the layers, where headers and trailers are removed at each layer.

### **Encapsulation Example:**
- **Layer 7**: Application data is wrapped in a header and passed to Layer 6.  
- **Layer 6**: The data from Layer 7 is encapsulated and passed to Layer 5, and so on.
- **At the Physical Layer**: The data is transmitted as an electromagnetic signal.

Upon reaching the receiving device, the data is **de-encapsulated**, with each layer removing its corresponding header or trailer, until it reaches Layer 7, where the original data is restored and passed to the application.

## **Layer Functions and Interfaces**
- Each layer communicates with its **peer layer** on the receiving device using **protocols**.
- The **interfaces between adjacent layers** define how data is passed from one layer to the next, ensuring proper communication and data flow.
- The **well-defined interfaces** allow layers to be independently modified without disrupting the entire system.

## **Grouping of Layers**
- **Network Support Layers**: Layers 1, 2, and 3 (Physical, Data Link, and Network) deal with the actual movement of data between devices and networks.
- **User Support Layers**: Layers 5, 6, and 7 (Session, Presentation, and Application) provide services that facilitate user interaction with the network.
- **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Serves as the bridge between the user support and network support layers.

## **OSI Model Summary:**
The OSI model provides a modular and flexible approach to designing network communication systems. By dividing the communication process into seven distinct layers, the OSI model facilitates **interoperability**, **modularity**, and **scalability** in network design.

# OSI Model Layers

## Physical Layer
The physical layer is responsible for transmitting raw bit streams over a physical medium. It defines the mechanical and electrical specifications required for data transmission. The primary responsibilities of this layer include:
- **Physical Characteristics**: Defines the interface between devices and transmission medium.
- **Representation of Bits**: Encodes bits into signals for transmission.
- **Data Rate**: Defines the transmission rate (bits per second).
- **Bit Synchronization**: Ensures sender and receiver are synchronized at the bit level.
- **Line Configuration**: Defines whether the connection is point-to-point or multipoint.
- **Physical Topology**: Describes the layout of the network, such as mesh, star, ring, bus, or hybrid topologies.
- **Transmission Mode**: Specifies the communication direction (simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex).

## Data Link Layer
The data link layer transforms the raw physical layer into a reliable communication link, ensuring error-free data transmission. Its key functions include:
- **Framing**: Breaks bit stream into frames.
- **Physical Addressing**: Adds addresses (sender/receiver) to frames for delivery.
- **Flow Control**: Manages data flow to avoid overwhelming the receiver.
- **Error Control**: Detects and retransmits lost or damaged frames.
- **Access Control**: Determines which device controls the shared link.

### Hop-to-Hop Delivery
Data link layer communication occurs between adjacent nodes (e.g., A to B to E to F). Each link handles its own local delivery, with different source and destination addresses.

## Network Layer
The network layer is responsible for source-to-destination delivery of packets, potentially across multiple networks. It manages:
- **Logical Addressing**: Adds logical addresses to packets for routing across networks.
- **Routing**: Determines the path for packet delivery across different networks.

### Source-to-Destination Delivery
Network layer ensures the delivery of packets from the source to the destination, potentially routing through multiple intermediate devices.

## Transport Layer
The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication between processes. It ensures message integrity, order, and flow control, including:
- **Service-point Addressing**: Assigns addresses for process-to-process communication.
- **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Divides large messages into smaller segments, and reassembles them at the destination.
- **Connection Control**: Can be connectionless or connection-oriented.
- **Flow Control**: Manages the flow of data between systems.
- **Error Control**: Ensures complete and correct delivery of messages from process to process.

## Session Layer
The session layer manages dialogues between systems. It controls the flow of communication by:
- **Dialog Control**: Manages half-duplex or full-duplex communication.
- **Synchronization**: Adds checkpoints to data streams to enable recovery from failures.

## Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data exchanged between systems is in a compatible format:
- **Translation**: Converts data between different encoding formats.
- **Encryption**: Ensures data privacy by transforming information into an unreadable format.
- **Compression**: Reduces the amount of data for efficient transmission.

## Application Layer
The application layer provides services directly to the user, enabling access to network resources. It includes:
- **Network Virtual Terminal**: Allows users to log on to remote systems.
- **File Transfer, Access, and Management**: Manages remote file access and transfers.
- **Mail Services**: Provides support for email forwarding and storage.
- **Directory Services**: Provides access to distributed databases containing global information.

## Summary of OSI Model Layers
- **Physical**: Transmits raw bits over the physical medium.
- **Data Link**: Organizes bits into frames and provides hop-to-hop delivery.
- **Network**: Manages source-to-destination delivery and routing.
- **Transport**: Ensures reliable process-to-process delivery with error control.
- **Session**: Controls dialogue and synchronizes data communication.
- **Presentation**: Handles data translation, encryption, and compression.
- **Application**: Provides access to network services for end-users.


# TCP/IP Protocol Suite

## Overview of TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The **TCP/IP protocol suite** was developed before the OSI model, so the layers do not exactly match those in the OSI model. Initially, TCP/IP was defined with **four layers**:
- **Host-to-network**
- **Internet**
- **Transport**
- **Application**

When compared to the OSI model:
- The **host-to-network layer** combines the functions of the **physical** and **data link layers** in OSI.
- The **internet layer** is equivalent to the **network layer** in OSI.
- The **application layer** in TCP/IP covers the **session**, **presentation**, and **application layers** in OSI.
- The **transport layer** in TCP/IP handles some duties of the OSI **session layer**.

The modern view of TCP/IP consists of **five layers**:
1. **Physical**
2. **Data Link**
3. **Network**
4. **Transport**
5. **Application**

These layers correspond to the first four layers of OSI, while the top three layers of OSI are represented by the **application layer** in TCP/IP.

### Layer Mapping Between TCP/IP and OSI
| TCP/IP Layer  | OSI Layer        |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Physical     | Physical         |
| Data Link    | Data Link        |
| Network      | Network          |
| Transport    | Transport        |
| Application  | Session, Presentation, Application |

## Key Concepts in TCP/IP

- **Hierarchical Protocol**: TCP/IP is hierarchical, where each upper-level protocol is supported by one or more lower-level protocols.
- **Modular**: The modules are not necessarily interdependent, meaning that different protocols can be mixed and matched according to system needs.
  
### Examples of TCP/IP Protocols:

- **Transport Layer**: 
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer.
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A connectionless protocol that doesn't guarantee data delivery but is faster.
  - **SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)**: A protocol designed for multi-streaming and multihoming.

- **Network Layer**:
  - **IP (Internet Protocol)**: The main protocol used for routing data across networks.
  - Additional protocols in this layer include ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), RARP (Reverse ARP), and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
## TCP/IP Protocol Characteristics

- **Independent Protocols**: The protocols at each layer of the TCP/IP suite can be combined in different ways to meet system needs, allowing flexibility and adaptability.
- **Modular Design**: Each protocol in the suite serves a specific function, allowing it to be swapped out if needed.
