# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a **connectionless** and **unreliable transport protocol** used in networking. Unlike TCP, which provides reliable communication with error checking and flow control, UDP is simpler and involves less overhead. It is used for applications that do not require the reliability of TCP, offering faster communication at the expense of error detection and retransmission.

## Characteristics of UDP

- **Connectionless**: UDP does not establish a connection before sending data. Each datagram (message) is independent and may follow different paths to reach the destination.
- **Unreliable**: There is no guarantee that data will arrive or be delivered in order. UDP does not have mechanisms for error recovery or retransmission.
- **Low Overhead**: UDP has minimal headers and performs fewer checks compared to other transport protocols like TCP, making it efficient for small messages or real-time applications.
- **Process-to-Process Communication**: UDP enables communication between processes on different machines, but it does not provide host-to-host communication or sequencing of messages.

## UDP Packet Structure

A UDP packet, also called a **user datagram**, has a fixed 8-byte header. The fields are:

1. **Source Port Number (16 bits)**: Identifies the source port of the sending process.
   - Ephemeral port number for clients.
   - Well-known port number for servers.
2. **Destination Port Number (16 bits)**: Identifies the destination port of the receiving process.
   - Well-known port for servers.
   - Ephemeral port for clients.
3. **Length (16 bits)**: Specifies the total length of the UDP packet (header + data).
   - Range from 0 to 65,535 bytes.
4. **Checksum (16 bits)**: Used to detect errors in the UDP datagram. It covers both the UDP header and the data, and is calculated using a pseudoheader from the IP layer.

### Length Field Consideration
- The length field in UDP is not strictly necessary, as the IP header already contains information on the packet's length. However, it is included for efficiency in calculating the length of the UDP datagram directly.

### Checksum Calculation
- The **checksum** covers the UDP datagram's header and data, as well as a **pseudoheader** from the IP layer. The pseudoheader includes:
  - Source and destination IP addresses (32 bits each)
  - Protocol field (8 bits)
  - UDP length (16 bits)
- If the checksum is not correct, the packet is discarded.

## UDP Operation

- **Connectionless Service**: Each UDP datagram is independent, with no need for connection establishment or termination.
- **No Flow Control**: UDP does not manage the flow of data between sender and receiver. This can result in packet loss if the receiver is overwhelmed.
- **No Error Control**: UDP does not guarantee data delivery. It relies on the application to handle errors if needed.
- **Encapsulation and Decapsulation**: UDP encapsulates data from the application layer into an IP datagram for transmission and decapsulates it at the receiver.
  
## Queuing in UDP

UDP uses queues associated with ports to handle incoming and outgoing messages:
- At the **client side**, ephemeral ports are used to identify queues.
  - **Incoming queue**: Stores incoming messages for the client.
  - **Outgoing queue**: Stores outgoing messages from the client.
  - If a queue overflows, UDP may drop the datagram or ask the process to wait.
  
- At the **server side**, the server uses well-known ports for queues.
  - **Incoming queue**: Handles messages sent to the server.
  - **Outgoing queue**: Handles responses sent from the server.

If no corresponding queue exists for a port, the message is discarded, and an ICMP **port unreachable** message is sent.

## Use Cases for UDP

1. **Simple Request-Response Communication**: UDP is used for lightweight communication where reliability and error control are not critical.
   - Example: DNS, where speed is more important than reliability.
   
2. **Multicasting**: UDP supports multicast communication, sending data to multiple recipients efficiently.
   - Example: Streaming services.

3. **Management Protocols**: UDP is commonly used in network management protocols like SNMP.
   
4. **Routing Protocols**: Protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol) use UDP for quick, simple message exchange.

5. **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)**: Although UDP is unreliable, TFTP uses it for file transfers and implements its own flow and error control mechanisms.

## Advantages of UDP
- **Low Overhead**: Suitable for applications that require fast transmission with minimal delay.
- **Efficient for Small Messages**: UDP is ideal for small, one-off messages where connection establishment and error checking would add unnecessary complexity.
- **Multicast Support**: UDP is the transport protocol of choice for multicast communication.

## Disadvantages of UDP
- **Unreliable**: No guarantees that data will arrive or be delivered in order.
- **No Flow Control**: Can lead to congestion or lost data if the receiver cannot keep up.
- **Limited Error Checking**: Only basic checksum validation is provided, which may not be sufficient for some applications.

# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

The second transport layer protocol we discuss in this chapter is called Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP, like UDP, is a process-to-process (program-to-program) protocol. TCP uses port numbers, but unlike UDP, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. It creates a virtual connection between two TCPs to send data and uses flow and error control mechanisms at the transport level.

In brief, TCP is called a connection-oriented, reliable transport protocol. It adds connection-oriented and reliability features to the services of IP.

## TCP Services

### Process-to-Process Communication
- Like UDP, TCP provides process-to-process communication using port numbers.

### Stream Delivery Service
- TCP is a stream-oriented protocol. Unlike UDP, which sends messages with predefined boundaries, TCP allows the sending process to deliver data as a stream of bytes and allows the receiving process to obtain data as a stream of bytes.
- The sending process writes to the stream of bytes, and the receiving process consumes (reads from) the stream.

### Sending and Receiving Buffers
- TCP uses two buffers: the sending buffer and the receiving buffer, one for each direction.
- Buffers are implemented using a circular array of 1-byte locations.
- The sending buffer contains:
  1. Empty chambers to be filled by the sending process (white section).
  2. Bytes that have been sent but not yet acknowledged (gray area).
  3. Bytes to be sent by the sending TCP (colored area).
- The receiving buffer contains:
  1. Empty chambers for bytes received from the network (white area).
  2. Received bytes ready to be read by the receiving process (colored sections).

### Segments
- TCP groups bytes into packets called segments, which are encapsulated in IP datagrams and transmitted.
- The segments are not necessarily the same size.
- TCP segments are created from the bytes in the buffers, with each segment carrying control information in addition to user data.

### Full-Duplex Communication
- TCP provides full-duplex communication, meaning data can flow in both directions simultaneously.
- Each TCP has a sending and receiving buffer, with segments moving in both directions.

### Connection-Oriented Service
- TCP is connection-oriented, unlike UDP. The process for establishing a connection involves:
  1. Establishing a connection between two TCPs.
  2. Exchanging data in both directions.
  3. Terminating the connection.
- TCP creates a virtual connection, not a physical one.

### Reliable Service
- TCP is a reliable transport protocol that uses an acknowledgment mechanism to confirm the safe arrival of data.

## TCP Features

### Numbering System
- TCP numbers all data bytes transmitted in a connection, independent in each direction.
- The numbering starts with a randomly generated number between 0 and 232 - 1.
- Example: If the random number is 1057 and the total data is 6000 bytes, the bytes are numbered from 1057 to 7056.

### Sequence Number
- After numbering the bytes, TCP assigns a sequence number to each segment. The sequence number is the number of the first byte in the segment.
- Example: For a 5000-byte file transferred in five segments, each carrying 1000 bytes:
  - Segment 1: Sequence Number: 10,001 (range: 10,001 to 11,000)
  - Segment 2: Sequence Number: 11,001 (range: 11,001 to 12,000)
  - Segment 3: Sequence Number: 12,001 (range: 12,001 to 13,000)
  - Segment 4: Sequence Number: 13,001 (range: 13,001 to 14,000)
  - Segment 5: Sequence Number: 14,001 (range: 14,001 to 15,000)

### Acknowledgment Number
- The acknowledgment number defines the number of the next byte the receiver expects to receive.
- It is cumulative, meaning if an acknowledgment number is 5643, it indicates that all bytes up to byte 5642 have been received.

### Flow Control
- TCP provides flow control to prevent the receiver from being overwhelmed by data.
- The receiver controls the amount of data sent by the sender.

### Error Control
- TCP implements an error control mechanism, using the segment as the unit of error detection (loss or corrupted segments), but error control is byte-oriented.

### Congestion Control
- TCP also handles congestion in the network. The amount of data sent by a sender is controlled by both the receiver (flow control) and the network's congestion level.

## Segment
- In TCP, a packet is referred to as a "segment".

## Simultaneous Open
- A **simultaneous open** occurs when both processes issue an active open.
- In this situation, both TCPs send a **SYN + ACK** segment to each other.
- A single connection is established between them.

## SYN Flooding Attack
- The **SYN flooding attack** is a security vulnerability in the TCP connection establishment process.
- A malicious attacker sends a large number of **SYN** segments to a server, faking source IP addresses.
- The server allocates resources, such as communication tables and timers, assuming these are legitimate connection requests.
- The server sends **SYN + ACK** segments to the fake clients, which are never received.
- This consumes resources on the server, and if the number of SYN requests is large, the server may crash due to resource depletion.
- This is a type of **denial-of-service (DoS) attack**.
- Some TCP implementations mitigate this attack by:
  - Limiting connection requests over time.
  - Filtering out unwanted source addresses.
  - Using a **cookie** strategy to postpone resource allocation until the connection is fully set up (also used in **SCTP**).

## Data Transfer
- After connection establishment, **bidirectional data transfer** occurs.
- Both client and server can send data and acknowledgments.
- Data and acknowledgment can travel together on the same segment (piggybacked).

### Example:
- After connection setup:
  - Client sends 2000 bytes of data in two segments.
  - Server sends 2000 bytes in one segment.
  - Client sends one more segment.
  - The first three segments carry both data and acknowledgment.
  - The last segment carries only acknowledgment, as no more data is sent.
- The **PSH (push)** flag is set in the client's segments to instruct the server to deliver the data immediately.
- The server's segment does not set the **PSH** flag.

## Pushing Data
- The sending TCP buffers data from the sending application and determines the segment size.
- The receiving TCP buffers the data and delivers it when ready or when convenient for TCP.
- In certain situations (e.g., interactive applications), the application program may need **immediate delivery** of data.
  - The sending application requests a **push operation**.
  - The sending TCP sends the data immediately and sets the **PSH** flag to ensure immediate delivery to the receiving application.
- Most implementations ignore push requests, leaving the decision to the TCP.

## Urgent Data
- **Urgent data** is used when the application requires a piece of data to be delivered out of order.
- The sending application may issue a command (e.g., **Ctrl + C**) to indicate urgent data.
- The sending TCP sets the **URG** bit and places urgent data at the beginning of the segment.
- The **urgent pointer** in the header marks the end of the urgent data.
- Upon receiving the segment, the receiving TCP delivers the urgent data immediately, out of order, to the receiving application.

## Connection Termination
- Either the client or server can initiate connection termination.
- Most implementations use **three-way handshaking** or **four-way handshaking** with a **half-close** option.

### Three-Way Handshaking:
1. Client sends a **FIN** segment after receiving a close command from the client process. This segment can carry data or just be a control segment.
2. The server responds with a **FIN + ACK** segment to confirm receipt and announce closing in the other direction.
3. The client sends an **ACK** segment to confirm the receipt of the server's **FIN** segment. This segment does not carry data.

### Half-Close:
- In a **half-close**, one end can stop sending data but still receive it.
- Typically initiated by the client.
- Example:
  - The client sends data to the server for processing and then closes the outbound direction by sending a **FIN** segment.
  - The server sends an **ACK** to accept the half-close but keeps the inbound direction open.
  - The server sends its processed data to the client and eventually sends a **FIN** segment, which the client acknowledges with an **ACK**.
- After the half-close:
  - Data can travel from server to client, and acknowledgments can travel from client to server.
  - The client cannot send more data, but can receive data.

## Acknowledgments and Retransmissions
- TCP uses **cumulative acknowledgment** where a single acknowledgment can acknowledge multiple segments.
- If segments are lost, TCP may trigger a **fast retransmission** based on duplicate acknowledgments.

### Example:
- If the receiver gets duplicate acknowledgments (e.g., for segment 3), the sender will retransmit segment 3 immediately, even if the timer for segment 3 has not expired.
- Only one segment is retransmitted despite receiving multiple duplicate acknowledgments, due to cumulative acknowledgment.
## Flow Control in TCP
- **Sliding Window Protocol**: TCP uses a sliding window to manage data flow. It combines aspects of Go-Back-N (no NAKs) and Selective Repeat (out-of-order segments are held until the missing ones arrive).
- **Key Differences**: 
  - TCP's window is **byte-oriented** (unlike frame-oriented at data link layer).
  - The window in TCP is **variable-sized** (unlike fixed-size in data link layer).
  
### Sliding Window Mechanism:
- **Window Operation**:
  - **Opening the window**: Moves the right wall to the right, allowing more bytes to be sent.
  - **Closing the window**: Moves the left wall to the right, acknowledging sent bytes.
  - **Shrinking the window**: Moves the right wall left, which is discouraged as it revokes eligibility of some bytes for sending.
  
- **Window Size**: Determined by the lesser of two values:
  - **Receiver window (rwnd)**: The number of bytes the receiver can accept before overflow.
  - **Congestion window (cwnd)**: Determined by network congestion to avoid network overload.

### Examples:
- **Example 23.4**: If host B's buffer size is 5000 bytes and 1000 bytes are unprocessed, rwnd = 4000 bytes (5000 - 1000).
- **Example 23.5**: If rwnd = 3000 bytes and cwnd = 3500 bytes, window size = min(rwnd, cwnd) = 3000 bytes.
- **Example 23.6**: With a sender having sent bytes up to 202 and rwnd = 9 bytes, the window size is min(20, 9) = 9 bytes.

### TCP Window Characteristics:
- **TCP’s Sliding Window** is byte-oriented.
- **Window Size**: The smaller of rwnd and cwnd.
- **Sender's Behavior**: The sender doesn't need to send the entire window's worth of data at once.
- **Acknowledgments**: The receiver can send an acknowledgment at any time without shrinking the window.

## Error Control in TCP
- **Reliability**: TCP ensures reliable data transfer by using error control mechanisms such as checksum, acknowledgment, and retransmission.
- **Error Detection**: Done through **checksum** (16-bit field in each segment). Corrupted segments are discarded.
- **Acknowledgments**: ACK segments confirm the receipt of data. ACK segments do not consume sequence numbers.
  
### Retransmission:
- **Retransmission on Timeout**: If a segment is not acknowledged within the timeout (RTO), it is retransmitted.
- **Fast Retransmission**: If three duplicate ACKs are received (indicating a lost segment), TCP immediately retransmits the missing segment without waiting for RTO to expire.
  
### Retransmission After RTO:
- **RTO Timer**: A dynamic retransmission timer is used. It is updated based on round-trip time (RTT) measurements.
  
### Retransmission After Three Duplicate ACKs:
- **Fast Retransmission**: This rule is triggered when a segment is lost, but subsequent out-of-order segments arrive, leading to duplicate ACKs. The missing segment is retransmitted immediately.

### Out-of-Order Segments:
- TCP temporarily stores out-of-order segments until the missing ones are received. The receiver does not deliver out-of-order segments to the application.
  
---

## TCP Scenarios

### Normal Operation:
- **Bidirectional Data Transfer**: Example shows server and client exchanging data with sequence numbers and ACKs. Acknowledgments are delayed to ensure that no segments are missed.
  
### Lost Segment:
- **Lost Segment Handling**: A lost segment is discarded, and the receiver stores subsequent out-of-order segments. When the timer for the missing segment expires, the sender retransmits it.

### Fast Retransmission:
- **Fast Retransmission Process**: If a segment is lost, multiple out-of-order segments arrive, causing the receiver to send duplicate ACKs. The sender then retransmits the missing segment immediately after three duplicate ACKs are received.

---

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Sliding Window** is used to prevent overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once.
- **Retransmission** is triggered by timeouts (RTO) or duplicate ACKs.
- **Out-of-order segments** are stored temporarily and not delivered to the application until missing data is received.
