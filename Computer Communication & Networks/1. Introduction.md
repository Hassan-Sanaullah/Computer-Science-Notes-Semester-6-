# Data Communications

## Introduction
When we communicate, we share information. This can be **local** (face-to-face) or **remote** (over distance). The term **telecommunication** refers to communication over a distance and includes telephony, telegraphy, and television.

- **Data**: Information represented in an agreed format.
- **Data Communications**: The exchange of data between two devices via a transmission medium (e.g., wire cable).

### Characteristics of an Effective Data Communication System
A data communication system must ensure:

1. **Delivery**: Data must reach the correct destination.
2. **Accuracy**: Data must remain unaltered during transmission.
3. **Timeliness**: Data must arrive on time; delayed data (especially in real-time applications like video/audio) may become useless.
4. **Jitter**: Variation in packet arrival time; inconsistent delay leads to poor quality in streaming applications.

## Components of a Data Communication System
A data communication system consists of five essential components:

1. **Message**: The information being communicated (text, numbers, images, audio, video).
2. **Sender**: The device that sends the message (computer, phone, camera).
3. **Receiver**: The device that receives the message (computer, TV, phone).
4. **Transmission Medium**: The physical path between sender and receiver (twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber optics, radio waves).
5. **Protocol**: A set of rules governing data communication. Without a common protocol, devices cannot communicate properly (e.g., a French speaker cannot understand Japanese).

# Data Flow

Communication between two devices can occur in three modes: **simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex**.

## Simplex
- **Unidirectional communication** (like a one-way street).
- One device **only transmits**, and the other **only receives**.
- Example: **Keyboard and monitor**  
  - The keyboard only sends input.  
  - The monitor only displays output.  
- **Advantage**: The entire channel capacity is used for transmission in one direction.

## Half-Duplex
- **Bidirectional communication**, but only **one device transmits at a time**.
- Like a **one-lane road** where traffic flows in both directions, but only one direction at a time.
- Example: **Walkie-talkies, CB radios**  
  - One person speaks, and the other listens.  
  - They must take turns to communicate.
- **Advantage**: The entire channel capacity is utilized for one direction at a time.

## Full-Duplex
- **Bidirectional communication occurs simultaneously**.
- Like a **two-way street** where traffic moves in both directions at the same time.
- Two ways to implement full-duplex:
  1. **Two separate transmission paths** (one for sending, one for receiving).
  2. **Channel capacity is divided** between both directions.
- Example: **Telephone network**  
  - Both people can talk and listen at the same time.
- **Advantage**: Enables real-time two-way communication, but channel capacity is shared between both directions.

# Networks

A **network** is a collection of devices (**nodes**) connected through communication links.  
Nodes can be **computers, printers, or any other device** capable of sending and receiving data.

## Distributed Processing
- **Distributed processing** divides tasks among multiple computers.
- Instead of a single machine handling everything, multiple computers share the workload.

## Network Criteria
A network must meet the following essential criteria:

### 1. Performance
- **Transit time**: The time required for a message to travel between devices.
- **Response time**: The time elapsed between an inquiry and a response.
- **Factors affecting performance**:
  - Number of users
  - Type of transmission medium
  - Hardware capabilities
  - Software efficiency
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Throughput**: The amount of data transferred over a given time.
  - **Delay**: The time taken for data to travel through the network.
  - **Trade-off**: Increasing throughput may increase delay due to congestion.

### 2. Reliability
- Accuracy of data delivery.
- Measured by:
  - **Frequency of failure**: How often the network fails.
  - **Recovery time**: Time taken to restore a failed link.
  - **Robustness**: Network’s ability to function during disasters.

### 3. Security
- Protection against **unauthorized access**.
- Prevention of **data corruption or loss**.
- Implementation of **policies for breach recovery**.

# Physical Topology

**Physical topology** refers to the physical arrangement of devices in a network.  
A network consists of:
- **Links**: Connections between two or more devices.
- **Nodes**: Devices such as computers, printers, or other hardware connected in the network.

## Types of Connections
1. **Point-to-Point**: A dedicated link between two devices.
2. **Multipoint**: A single link is shared by multiple devices.

## Types of Network Topologies
There are **five basic topologies**: **Mesh, Star, Bus, Ring, and Hybrid**.

### 1. Mesh Topology
- **Each device has a dedicated point-to-point link** with every other device.
- **Number of links required** for $n$ devices:
  $$
  \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}
  $$
- **Advantages**:
  - Dedicated links ensure there is **no traffic congestion**.
  - Highly **robust**; failure of one link does not affect the entire system.
  - **High security and privacy** since messages travel on dedicated lines.
  - Easy **fault detection and isolation** since each link can be monitored separately.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **High installation cost** due to the large number of cables.
  - **Requires extensive space** for cabling.
  - **Expensive hardware**, as each device needs multiple I/O ports.
- **Use case**: Used in **backbone networks** connecting major servers or **telephone regional offices**.

### 2. Star Topology
- **Each device connects to a central controller (hub)** via a dedicated point-to-point link.
- **Devices cannot communicate directly**; all data must go through the hub.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Less cabling** required compared to mesh topology.
  - **Easy to install and reconfigure**; adding or removing a device only requires modifying one connection.
  - **Robust**; if one device fails, only that link is affected.
  - **Easier fault identification** since the hub can monitor link issues.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Single point of failure**: If the hub fails, the entire network goes down.
  - **More cabling required** compared to bus or ring topologies.
- **Use case**: Commonly used in **Local Area Networks (LANs)**, especially in **high-speed networks**.

### 3. Bus Topology
- **A single backbone cable** connects multiple devices via **drop lines** and **taps**.
- **Signals travel in both directions** along the backbone.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Easy installation**; the backbone cable follows an efficient path, and devices connect via drop lines.
  - **Less cabling** than mesh or star topology.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Difficult to add new devices** without modifying or replacing the backbone.
  - **Signal reflection** at taps can degrade quality.
  - **A break in the backbone disrupts the entire network**.
- **Use case**: Early **Ethernet LANs** (now less common).

### 4. Ring Topology
- **Each device has a dedicated point-to-point link** with **two** neighboring devices.
- Data travels **in one direction** until it reaches the destination.
- **Each device has a built-in repeater** that regenerates signals.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Easy to install and reconfigure**; adding or removing a device only affects two links.
  - **Fault isolation is simplified** since a device can detect if the signal is interrupted.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Unidirectional traffic** can lead to network failure if one device malfunctions.
  - **A single break can disable the entire network** unless a dual ring or special switches are used.
- **Use case**: **IBM Token Ring networks** (less common today due to high-speed alternatives).

### 5. Hybrid Topology
- **Combination of two or more topologies**.
- Example: **A star topology as a backbone**, with **bus topology branches**.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Flexible and scalable**; different sections of the network can use different topologies.
  - **Can be optimized** for performance, reliability, and cost.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **More complex** to design and manage.
  - **Higher cost** due to different types of network components.
- **Use case**: Used in **large-scale networks** like corporate infrastructures and **data centers**.

# Categories of Networks

Networks are generally classified into three primary categories based on their size and coverage:  
1. **Local Area Network (LAN)** – Covers a small geographical area (≤ 2 miles).  
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)** – Can be worldwide.  
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** – Falls between LAN and WAN, covering a city or town.

## 1. Local Area Network (LAN)
- **Privately owned** and links devices within a small area such as an office, building, or campus.
- **Examples**:
  - A **home office** with two PCs and a printer.
  - A **corporate LAN** connecting workstations, printers, and servers.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Limited size**: Usually extends only a few kilometers.
  - **Resource sharing**: Allows multiple users to share hardware (printers), software, and data.
  - **Topologies used**: Common LAN topologies include **bus, ring, and star**.
  - **Transmission medium**: Typically uses **wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi) technologies**.
  - **Speeds**: 
    - Early LANs: **4–16 Mbps**  
    - Modern LANs: **100–1000 Mbps**  
    - Wireless LANs: Discussed separately.

## 2. Wide Area Network (WAN)
- **Covers large geographic areas**, such as a country, continent, or the entire world.
- **Supports long-distance transmission** of data, images, audio, and video.
- **Types of WANs**:
  - **Switched WAN**: A **Switched WAN** uses **switching technology** to establish dynamic, temporary connections between different locations. The connection between two endpoints is not dedicated but rather created only when required.
  - **Point-to-Point WAN**: A **Point-to-Point WAN** uses a **dedicated, permanent link** between two locations, ensuring a constant, fixed connection between the two endpoints.
- **Examples**:
  - - **Internet**: The most common and largest example of a WAN. It connects millions of LANs around the world.
- **Corporate WAN**: A company’s network connecting offices in different cities or countries. For example, a multinational company with offices in New York, London, and Tokyo might have a WAN to connect these locations securely.
- **Telecommunication Networks**: The network that spans large distances to connect users, like the infrastructure used by mobile phone carriers.
## 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- **Covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN** (typically a **city or town**).
- **Designed for organizations** needing high-speed Internet or connectivity across a **wider urban area**.
- **Examples**:
  - - **City-Wide Wi-Fi**: Some cities have public Wi-Fi networks that provide internet access across a metropolitan area.
- **University Network**: A university with multiple campuses in a city could use a MAN to connect them all.
- **Cable Television Network**: Some cable service providers use MANs to distribute TV signals and internet services across a city.
  
## 4. Interconnection of Networks: Internetwork
- **LANs, MANs, and WANs are rarely isolated**; they are connected to form **internetworks** (internets).
- **Example**:
  - A company with **two offices**:  
    - West coast office uses a **bus topology LAN**.
    - East coast office uses a **star topology LAN**.
  - The company president, located elsewhere, requires remote access.
  - Solution:
    - A **switched WAN** connects the offices.
    - **Point-to-point WANs** (e.g., DSL or cable) provide additional connections.
  - **Result**: A **heterogeneous network** with **multiple WANs and LANs**.

# The Internet

The Internet has significantly transformed both business and leisure activities. It enables various functions such as:
- **Communication**: Sending emails, chatting online.
- **Information Access**: Reading online newspapers, researching topics.
- **Financial Transactions**: Paying bills, online shopping.
- **Entertainment**: Streaming movies, gaming, or joining online communities.
- **Booking Services**: Reserving hotels, flights, or movie tickets.

## The Internet Today
- The Internet has evolved from a simple hierarchical structure into a **vast, interconnected network** of **LANs, WANs, and switching stations**.
- New networks are **constantly added**, and outdated networks are **removed**.
- Internet access is primarily provided by **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**.


## Levels of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
### Hierarchical Organization of ISPs
## 🟩 1. International ISP (Also known as Tier 1 ISP)

### 📡 Role:
- Provides internet to end-users  
- Usually installs modems, routers, and last-mile connectivity  
- Often uses fiber, DSL, or wireless

### 🏠 Examples:
Your neighborhood internet company, WiFi providers, local broadband services

### 💡 Keywords:
End-user, last-mile, direct access


# Protocols and Standards

## **Protocols**
In computer networks, **communication occurs between entities** in different systems. An **entity** is anything that can **send or receive** information. However, for effective communication, entities must follow a **protocol**.

### **Definition of a Protocol**
A **protocol** is a set of **rules that govern data communication**. It specifies:
- **What** is communicated.
- **How** it is communicated.
- **When** it is communicated.

### **Key Elements of a Protocol**
1. **Syntax**  
   - Defines the **structure or format** of data.  
   - Example: A protocol may expect:
     - **First 8 bits** → Sender’s address.
     - **Second 8 bits** → Receiver’s address.
     - **Remaining bits** → Actual message.

2. **Semantics**  
   - Defines the **meaning** of data and the corresponding **action**.  
   - Example: An address may specify either:
     - The **final destination** of a message.
     - The **route** the message should take.

3. **Timing**  
   - Determines **when data should be sent** and **how fast**.  
   - Example: If a sender transmits at **100 Mbps** but the receiver can only process **1 Mbps**, data loss may occur.

### **Importance of Protocols**
- **Ensures interoperability** between devices.
- **Prevents data loss** by managing speed and synchronization.
- **Defines rules for communication**, ensuring efficient data transfer.

Protocols play a crucial role in **networking, ensuring smooth and error-free communication** between systems.
