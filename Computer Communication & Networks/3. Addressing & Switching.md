# Addressing in TCP/IP

## Overview of Addressing

In a TCP/IP-based network, four levels of addresses are used to ensure proper communication and routing:
1. **Physical (Link) Addresses**
2. **Logical (IP) Addresses**
3. **Port Addresses**
4. **Specific Addresses**

Each address type is associated with a different layer in the TCP/IP architecture, as shown in the figure below.

### Address Types and Their Layers
| Address Type     | Layer            |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Physical         | Data Link Layer  |
| Logical          | Network Layer    |
| Port             | Transport Layer  |
| Specific         | Application Layer|

## Physical (Link) Addresses

- **Physical Address**: Also known as the **link address**, it identifies a node on the network at the data link layer (Layer 2).
- These addresses are used to define devices on **LANs** or **WANs**.
- The physical address is embedded in the frame used by the data link layer and is the **lowest-level address**.
- **Format**: The size and format of physical addresses vary depending on the network. For instance:
  - **Ethernet** uses a 6-byte (48-bit) physical address, often printed on a **network interface card (NIC)**.
  - **LocalTalk (Apple)** uses a 1-byte dynamic address that changes each time the station is powered on.

### Example 2.1: Physical Addressing in Action
In a bus topology LAN, Node 1 (with physical address 10) sends a frame to Node 2 (with physical address 87). The frame contains:
- The **destination physical address (87)** for Node 2.
- The **source physical address (10)** for Node 1.
The data link layer encapsulates the data, adding a **header** (containing source and destination physical addresses) and a **trailer** for error detection. Nodes on the network that do not match the destination address (87) discard the frame.

### Example 2.2: Ethernet Physical Address
Ethernet addresses are written as a 6-byte (12 hexadecimal digits) address separated by colons, such as:
		**07:01:02:01:2C:4B**

## Logical (IP) Addresses

- **Logical Address**: These addresses are essential for routing data across the internet, regardless of the underlying physical network. They are assigned to devices to ensure universal identification.
- An **IP address** (currently a 32-bit address) is used to uniquely identify hosts on the Internet. 
- **Requirement**: No two publicly accessible devices on the Internet can share the same IP address.

### Example 2.3: Logical Addressing in Action
In a network with three LANs connected by routers:
- Each device (computer or router) has a pair of **physical** and **logical** addresses.
- Logical addresses (e.g., **A** and **P**) remain consistent as data moves across the network, but **physical addresses** change at each hop.
- The **source** device encapsulates data into a **packet**, adding its logical source address (A) and the destination logical address (P). At each hop, the **data link layer** replaces the physical address, but the logical addresses stay the same.

### Logical Addressing Key Point
- Logical addresses are used for routing across different networks, while physical addresses are only relevant within a local network.

## Port Addresses

- **Port Address**: Port addresses are used to identify specific processes or applications running on a device.
- In TCP/IP, a **port address** is a **16-bit** value (ranging from 0 to 65535).
- Port addresses allow multiple applications on the same device to communicate over the same network connection. For instance, **FTP** and **TELNET** can run concurrently on different ports.

### Example 2.4: Port Addressing in Action
Two computers, **Computer A** and **Computer B**, each run multiple processes. The sending computer has three processes with port addresses **a**, **b**, and **c**, while the receiving computer has port addresses **j** and **k**. When a process on **Computer A** (port **a**) needs to communicate with a process on **Computer B** (port **j**), the transport layer adds the **port addresses** to the packet. This ensures that the data reaches the correct process at the destination.

### Port Addressing Key Points
- Port addresses enable communication between processes, ensuring the correct process receives the data.
- Logical and port addresses **remain the same** as data travels from source to destination, even as physical addresses change.

### Example 2.5: Port Address Format
A port address is represented by a **16-bit number**, such as:
		**753**

## Specific Addresses

- **Specific Address**: These are user-friendly addresses associated with specific applications, like email addresses or URLs.
  - Example: **Email Address**: `forouzan@fhda.edu`
  - Example: **URL**: `www.mhhe.com`
- When these addresses are used, they are converted to **port** and **logical addresses** by the sending computer to route the data correctly.

### Specific Addressing Key Points
- Specific addresses like email or URLs are human-readable but get converted into logical and port addresses by the network stack to facilitate data delivery.

# Circuit-Switched Networks

Circuit-switched networks are a type of communication system where a dedicated path is established between two stations for the duration of their communication session. This method is typically used in traditional telephone networks and provides a continuous and predictable transmission medium.

## Key Features of Circuit Switching

### 1. **Physical Layer**
   - Circuit switching operates at the **physical layer** of the OSI model. A dedicated physical connection is made between the sender and the receiver, and it stays active throughout the duration of the communication session.

### 2. **Continuous Data Flow**
   - Once the circuit is established, data flows continuously between the two stations. This uninterrupted transmission allows for smooth communication, making it suitable for real-time applications like voice calls.

### 3. **Setup Time**
   - Before any data can be transmitted, a **setup phase** occurs where the network establishes the dedicated path. This phase includes reserving resources (such as bandwidth and switches) and typically introduces a delay at the beginning of the communication. 

### 4. **Dedicated Resources**
   - The resources along the communication path, including bandwidth and processing power of the switches, are **reserved exclusively** for the communication session. These resources remain dedicated to the connection for its entire duration, even during periods of silence or inactivity.

## Advantages of Circuit-Switched Networks

- **Predictable Performance**: Since the path is reserved for the entire communication session, circuit-switched networks provide reliable and consistent performance. This is ideal for real-time applications like voice or video communication, where consistent data flow and low latency are crucial.
  
- **No Congestion**: With a dedicated path, there is no competition for bandwidth, reducing the chances of congestion or packet delays. This ensures the communication is uninterrupted and has minimal delay during the transfer.

## Disadvantages of Circuit-Switched Networks

- **Inefficient Resource Usage**: Resources are reserved for the entire duration of the communication session, even if no data is being transmitted (for example, during silent periods in a phone call). This can lead to inefficient use of the network's resources.
  
- **Scalability Limitations**: The requirement to establish a dedicated path for every communication session limits the ability of the network to scale efficiently. A large number of simultaneous connections can strain the available resources.

## Total Communication Time Breakdown

The total time for a communication session in a circuit-switched network consists of several key components:

1. **Setup Time**: The initial time required to establish the dedicated path between the two stations. This phase involves the allocation of resources, which introduces an initial delay.

2. **Transmission Time**: The period when data is actively transmitted over the established path. The time taken for the data to reach the destination is largely determined by the amount of data being sent and the bandwidth of the path.

3. **Propagation Delay**: The time it takes for the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. This is affected by the physical distance between the stations and the properties of the transmission medium (e.g., fiber optics, copper cables).

4. **Teardown Time**: Once all data has been transmitted, the circuit is released, and the resources are returned to the network. This final phase involves tearing down the connection.

### Formula for Total Time:
$$Total~Time = Setup~Time + Transmission~Time + Propagation~Delay + Teardown~Time$$


## Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching

In comparison to packet-switched networks, which split data into packets that are routed independently, circuit-switched networks reserve a dedicated path for the entire communication session. While this ensures predictable performance and no congestion, packet switching offers more flexibility and efficiency for handling large volumes of data and multiple users.

### Key Differences:
- **Circuit Switching**: Dedicated path, reserved resources, continuous flow of data, less efficient when the network is idle, good for real-time communication.
- **Packet Switching**: Flexible path routing, dynamic resource allocation, more efficient for bursty data, but can experience delays due to packet routing and queuing.

Circuit-switched networks are still widely used for voice communication, but for data-heavy applications like internet browsing or file sharing, packet-switched networks are preferred due to their scalability and efficient use of resources.


## Advantages of Packet Switching

- **Efficiency in Resource Usage**: Since resources (such as bandwidth and switch buffers) are dynamically allocated, packet switching is more efficient than circuit switching, especially for bursty data.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The network can adapt to failures by re-routing packets through alternate paths, ensuring more reliable communication.
- **Scalability**: Packet-switched networks can scale easily to accommodate more users, as the network can dynamically allocate resources based on demand.

## Disadvantages of Packet Switching

- **Delay and Jitter**: The store-and-forward process and potential congestion in the network can introduce delays and variations in the arrival times of packets (jitter), which may affect real-time applications like voice and video calls.
- **Packet Loss**: In heavily congested networks, packets can be dropped if buffers overflow, leading to the need for retransmission and potential data loss.

## Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching

- **Packet Switching**: Offers greater flexibility and efficiency in handling multiple users and varying data loads. It's well-suited for data-heavy applications like web browsing, email, and file sharing.
- **Circuit Switching**: Provides a dedicated path and guarantees consistent performance, making it ideal for real-time applications but less efficient in utilizing network resources.

Packet switching is the backbone of the modern internet, allowing for flexible and efficient communication across vast, global networks.
