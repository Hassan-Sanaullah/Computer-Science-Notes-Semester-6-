# Color Models  

## The HSI Color Model  

Creating colors in the **RGB, CMY, and CMYK** models and converting between them is straightforward. These models are ideal for hardware implementations. The **RGB model** aligns well with human vision, as the eye is sensitive to **red, green, and blue**.  

However, **RGB and CMY models are not intuitive** for human color description. People describe colors using:  

- **Hue (H):** The attribute that defines a pure color (e.g., yellow, orange, red).  
- **Saturation (S):** The measure of how much a pure color is diluted by white light.  
- **Brightness (Intensity, I):** A subjective descriptor that represents achromatic intensity.  

### Why HSI?  
The **HSI model** separates the **intensity** component from the color-carrying components (**hue and saturation**). This makes it more **intuitive for color processing** based on human perception.  

- **RGB is ideal** for image generation (e.g., cameras, displays).  
- **HSI is ideal** for color description and processing.  

### Extracting Intensity from an RGB Image  
An **RGB image** consists of three grayscale intensity images (red, green, and blue). The intensity can be extracted using the formula:  

$I = \frac{R + G + B}{3}$  

This formula is derived by considering the **color cube**, where:  

- The **black vertex (0,0,0)** is at the bottom.  
- The **white vertex (1,1,1)** is at the top.  
- The **intensity axis** is the line joining black and white.  

A **plane perpendicular** to the intensity axis will intersect it at a point that gives the **intensity value** in the range **[0,1]**.  
(see fig 6.10 on page 411)
### Understanding Saturation  
- **Saturation** increases as the distance from the **intensity axis** increases.  
- **Points on the intensity axis have zero saturation** (they are grayscale).  

### Understanding Hue  
- Hue can be determined from an **RGB value** using geometric relationships.  
- If a plane passes through **black, white, and a color (e.g., cyan)**, all points in that plane share the **same hue**.  
- Rotating this plane about the **intensity axis** changes the hue.  

### The HSI Color Space  
- The **HSI space** consists of:  
  - A **vertical intensity axis**.  
  - A **locus of colors** in planes perpendicular to the axis.  
- As **planes move up and down**, they form **triangular or hexagonal** shapes when intersecting the RGB cube.  
(see fig 6.11 on page 413)
#### Hue and Saturation Representation  
- **Primary colors (RGB) are separated by 120°** in the hue circle.  
- **Secondary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) are 60° from the primaries**.  
- The **hue of a point** is determined by the angle from a reference (usually red at 0°).  
- **Saturation is the distance from the intensity axis**.  

### Alternative Representations  
- The **HSI space** can be represented as:  
  - **Hexagons** (color wheel view).  
  - **Triangles** (color mixing).  
  - **Circles** (continuous hue representation).  

All these shapes can be transformed into each other using **geometric transformations**.  

# Color Transformations

## Definition  
A **color transformation** refers to the process of altering the color values of an image based on a mathematical function. It can be represented as:

$$
s_i = T_i (r_i), \quad i = 1,2,... , n
$$

where:  
- $n$ is the number of color components in the image (e.g., 3 for RGB, 4 for CMYK).  
- $r_i$ represents the intensity values of the input color components.  
- $s_i$ represents the intensity values of the transformed (output) image.  
- $T_i$ is the transformation function applied to each component.  

### Color Models and Component Count
Different color models define color using a different number of components:  
- **RGB, CMY, and HSI** use **three** components ($n = 3$).  
- **CMYK** uses **four** components ($n = 4$).  
- The transformation $T$ applied can be **different for each component** (e.g., Red, Green, Blue in RGB).  

Even though any transformation can be performed in **any** color space, some operations are **better suited** for specific models. For example, brightness adjustments are easier in **HSI** than in **RGB**.

---

## Intensity Modification Example  
If we modify the **intensity** of an image by multiplying the pixel values by a constant $k$ (where $k$ is in the range $[0,1]$), the transformation varies depending on the color model:

### **HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity)**
- Only the **intensity** component is modified:
  
  $$
  s_1 = r_1, \quad s_2 = r_2, \quad s_3 = k r_3
  $$

  - **Hue (H) and Saturation (S) remain unchanged**, ensuring that only brightness is adjusted.

### **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**
- Each component is modified by multiplying with $k$:

  $$
  s_i = k r_i, \quad i = 1,2,3
  $$

  - The image appears uniformly darker or brighter.
  - This transformation **does not** preserve the perceived brightness in the same way as HSI.

### **CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)**
- All three components are modified, but with an additional offset:

  $$
  s_i = k r_i + (1-k), \quad i = 1,2,3
  $$

  - This transformation **ensures that white areas remain white** even when intensity is reduced.

### **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)**
- Only the **black (K) component** is modified:

  $$
  s_1 = r_1, \quad s_2 = r_2, \quad s_3 = r_3, \quad s_4 = k r_4 + (1 - k)
  $$

  - This helps in reducing ink usage while keeping color consistency.

---

## General Formulation  
Color transformations for multispectral images can be modeled using:

$$
s_i = T_i(r_i), \quad i = 1,2,..., n
$$

where each transformation function $T_i$ operates on $r_i$ to produce $s_i$.  

For **RGB color images**:  
- $n = 3$  
- $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ are the intensity values of the input image.  
- $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ are the transformed values in the output image.  

Each transformation $T_i$ can be different for each color component.

---

## Example: CMYK Image Breakdown  (page 432)
To better understand how color models work, consider an image of strawberries:

### **CMYK Components**
- **Strawberries** contain large amounts of **magenta** and **yellow**.  
- **Black (K)** is used in dark regions like coffee and shadows.  

### **RGB Equivalent**
- Strawberries contain a large amount of **red** and very little **green** and **blue**.  

### **HSI Equivalent**
- **Intensity (I)** appears as a grayscale version of the image.  
- **Saturation (S)** is highest where colors are pure.  
- **Hue (H)** can be difficult to interpret due to discontinuities at **0° and 360°**.  

---

## Choosing the Right Color Space  
- Any transformation **can** be performed in **any** color space.  
- However, some transformations are **better suited** for specific models.  
- Example: **Modifying intensity**  
  - **HSI**: Modify only the **intensity** component.  
  - **RGB**: Modify all three components equally.  
  - **CMY**: Modify all three components with an additional offset.  
  - **CMYK**: Modify only the **K** component.  

---

## Summary  
- Color transformations modify pixel intensity values while keeping the color model intact.  
- Different color models require different transformation techniques.  
- Intensity changes affect different components depending on the chosen color model.  
- Some color models are better suited for certain operations (e.g., HSI for intensity changes).  

# Color Complements

## Definition
The **color circle** (or **color wheel**) is a visual representation of colors based on their chromatic relationships. It was first conceptualized by **Sir Isaac Newton** in the 17th century by connecting the ends of the color spectrum.

- The primary colors (**Red, Green, Blue**) are equidistant from each other.
- The secondary colors (**Cyan, Magenta, Yellow**) are placed between them.
- **Hues directly opposite each other on the color circle are complements.**

## Color Complements in RGB
In the **RGB** color model, complementary colors are defined as:

| **Color** | **Complement** |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Red       | Cyan           |
| Green     | Magenta        |
| Blue      | Yellow         |

Each of these complements is found by subtracting the **original** RGB values from 1:

$$
s_i = 1 - r_i, \quad i = 1,2,3
$$

where:
- $s_i$ is the transformed color component.
- $r_i$ is the input color component.
- $i$ represents **Red, Green, and Blue**.

The result is similar to grayscale negatives but applied to **color images**. This technique is useful for **enhancing details in dark areas**.

## Color Complements in HSI
In the **HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity)** color space, computing the complement is not as straightforward:

- **Hue (H) is shifted by 0.5 (180° in degrees)**:
  
  $$
  H_{\text{out}} =
  \begin{cases} 
  H_{\text{in}} + 0.5, & 0.0 \leq H_{\text{in}} \leq 0.5 \\
  H_{\text{in}} - 0.5, & 0.5 < H_{\text{in}} \leq 1.0
  \end{cases}
  $$

- **Saturation (S) remains unchanged**:

  $$
  S_{\text{out}} = S_{\text{in}}
  $$

- **Intensity (I) is inverted**:

  $$
  I_{\text{out}} = 1 - I_{\text{in}}
  $$

Unlike **RGB complements**, the **saturation component** of an HSI complement **cannot be computed solely** from the saturation component of the input image. The transformation affects **hue and intensity** directly, leading to **visual differences between RGB and HSI complements**.

## Applications of Color Complements
- Enhancing **details in dark regions**.
- Creating **photographic color negatives**.
- **Color correction** and **image balancing**.
- Artistic effects in **image processing** and **graphic design**.

### Example: Computing Color Complements
Given an image in **RGB**:
- **Reds** in the original become **Cyan** in the complement.
- **Greens** become **Magenta**.
- **Blues** become **Yellow**.
- **Black** regions turn **white**, and vice versa.

These transformations are predictable using the **color circle**, making **color complements** an essential tool in **digital image processing**.

# Color Slicing

## Definition
Color slicing is a technique used to **highlight specific colors** in an image while suppressing others. It helps in:
1. **Isolating objects** with a particular color.
2. **Enhancing specific color regions** while neutralizing the background.
3. **Creating masks** for further image processing.

Unlike grayscale intensity slicing, color slicing works in a **multi-dimensional color space**, meaning transformations depend on multiple color components.

---

## Methods of Color Slicing
Color slicing can be done using two approaches:  
### **1. Cube (Hypercube for $n > 3$)**
A cube-shaped region is defined around a specific target color $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$, where:
- $W$ is the width of the cube.
- Any color within this cube is **preserved**.
- Colors **outside** this cube are changed to a neutral value (e.g., gray).

The transformation is:

$$
s_i =
\begin{cases} 
r_i, & \text{if} \quad \max_j |r_j - a_j| \leq W/2, \quad j = 1,2,...,n \\
0.5, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

#### **Explanation:**
- $r_i$ is the input color component (e.g., R, G, or B).
- $s_i$ is the output (transformed) color component.
- $a_j$ is the center of the cube (target color).
- $W/2$ ensures that all colors **within the cube** are kept unchanged.
- If a pixel’s color value is **outside the cube**, it is replaced with **0.5 (gray)**.

**Example:**  
If selecting red as the target color in RGB, colors **close to red** remain unchanged, while non-red colors turn gray.

---

### **2. Sphere (Hypersphere for $n > 3$)**
A spherical region is used instead of a cube. This ensures **smoother color transitions** because distances are measured **radially** from the target color.

$$
s_i =
\begin{cases} 
r_i, & \text{if} \quad \sum_{j=1}^{n} (r_j - a_j)^2 \leq R_0^2 \\
0.5, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

#### **Explanation:**
- The term $\sum_{j=1}^{n} (r_j - a_j)^2$ calculates the **squared Euclidean distance** between the input color and the target color.
- $R_0$ is the **radius** of the sphere.
- If the color is **inside the sphere** (distance ≤ $R_0$), it remains unchanged.
- If it is **outside the sphere**, it is set to **0.5 (gray)**.

**Key Difference from Cube Approach:**  
- **Cube slicing** can create sharp edges in color selection.  
- **Sphere slicing** allows a **gradual transition**, making it more **natural-looking**.

---

## Applications of Color Slicing
- **Object segmentation**: Identifying objects of a particular color in an image.
- **Feature enhancement**: Making specific colors stand out.
- **Medical imaging**: Isolating specific tissues based on color.
- **Agriculture**: Identifying crops or fruits in an image.

---

## Example: Extracting Strawberries from an Image
- **Target color selected**: Red **(0.6863, 0.1608, 0.1922)**
- **Threshold values**:
  - **Cube method:** $W = 0.2549$  
  - **Sphere method:** $R_0 = 0.1765$  
- **Results**:
  - **Cube-based slicing** captured most of the red regions but introduced sharp boundaries.
  - **Sphere-based slicing** provided smoother selection, preserving more of the strawberries’ red areas.

---

## Summary
- **Color slicing highlights a specific color range** by setting unwanted colors to a neutral value.
- **Cube-based slicing** defines a rectangular region and may produce sharp transitions.
- **Sphere-based slicing** creates a smoother selection by considering the distance from the target color.
- The **sphere approach is usually better** for natural-looking results.

Advanced techniques like **machine learning and clustering** (e.g., K-means) can further improve color segmentation.

# Tone and Color Corrections

## **Definition**
Tone and color correction involves adjusting an image’s **tonal range** and **color balance** to improve its visual quality.  
- The **tonal range** (also called the **key type**) refers to the **distribution of color intensities** in an image.
- Adjusting the tonal range ensures that the image has a balanced **contrast** and **brightness**.

---

## **Types of Key Images**
1. **High-Key Images**  
   - Most information is concentrated at **high intensities** (bright areas).
   - Appears **overexposed**.
   
2. **Low-Key Images**  
   - Most information is concentrated at **low intensities** (dark areas).
   - Appears **underexposed**.
   
3. **Middle-Key Images**  
   - The intensities are **evenly distributed** between shadows and highlights.
   - Considered a **balanced** image.

### **Correction Strategy**
- Similar to grayscale correction, it is often desirable to **distribute intensities equally** between highlights and shadows.
- This can be done using **intensity transformations** in different color spaces.

---

## **Tonal Transformations**
Tonal transformations modify **brightness and contrast** without changing color.  
- In **RGB and CMY(K)** spaces: Apply the same transformation to all color components (except $K$ in CMYK).
- In **HSI space**: Modify only the **intensity** component.

### **Common Tonal Issues & Corrections**
1. **Flat Images**  
   - Lack contrast and appear dull.
   - **Correction:** Apply an **S-shaped contrast enhancement curve**.
   
2. **Light (High-Key) Images**  
   - Appear **too bright** with washed-out colors.
   - **Correction:** Use a **gamma correction** function that reduces brightness.

3. **Dark (Low-Key) Images**  
   - Appear **too dark**, with details hidden in shadows.
   - **Correction:** Use a **gamma correction** function that increases brightness.

---

## **Transformation Functions**
1. **S-Curve Transformation (Contrast Enhancement)**
   - **Boosts contrast** while maintaining midtones.
   - The function is:

 $$
   S_{\text{out}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(S_{\text{in}} - m)}}
$$

   Where:
   - $S_{\text{in}}$ is the input intensity.
   - $S_{\text{out}}$ is the corrected intensity.
   - $k$ controls the **steepness** of the curve.
   - $m$ adjusts the **midpoint**.

2. **Gamma Correction (Adjusting Light & Dark Tones)**
   - Corrects **light and dark** images.
   - The transformation is:

 $$
   S_{\text{out}} = S_{\text{in}}^\gamma
$$

   Where:
   - $\gamma > 1$ **brightens** dark images.
   - $\gamma < 1$ **darkens** bright images.

3. **Piecewise Linear Transformations**
   - Uses multiple **linear segments** to **map intensities smoothly**.
   - Common in **histogram equalization** techniques.

---

# Histogram Processing of Color Images

## **Overview**
Histogram processing is a technique used to **enhance images automatically** by modifying the intensity distribution. Unlike grayscale images, color images have multiple components (e.g., RGB or HSI), making independent histogram equalization problematic.

## **Challenges in Color Histogram Equalization**
- **Independent equalization of RGB channels** can introduce **color distortions**.
- The transformation should **preserve hues** while improving contrast.
- A better approach is to **equalize only the intensity component** in color spaces like **HSI**.

---

## **Histogram Equalization in the HSI Color Space**
The **HSI color model** (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) is well-suited for histogram processing because:
1. **Intensity (I) contains brightness information**—it can be equalized without altering colors.
2. **Hue (H) and Saturation (S) remain unchanged**, preserving natural colors.

### **Example: Histogram Equalization in the HSI Space**
1. **Original Image Analysis**
   - The image contains **many dark colors**.
   - The median intensity is **0.36** (on a scale of **0 to 1**), meaning it is relatively dark.
   
2. **Applying Histogram Equalization**
   - The **intensity component is equalized** to redistribute brightness more uniformly.
   - The hue and saturation are **left unchanged**.

3. **Results**
   - The overall image becomes **brighter**.
   - More **details become visible**, such as the grain on a wooden surface.
   - The intensity histogram of the new image shows a **more uniform** distribution.

4. **Saturation Adjustment**
   - After equalization, **some colors appear less vibrant**.
   - To fix this, the **saturation component is slightly increased**, restoring color richness.

---

## **Mathematical Formulation**
### **Histogram Equalization Formula**
Given an input intensity $I$, histogram equalization finds a new intensity $I'$:

$$
I' = \frac{(L - 1)}{N} \sum_{j=0}^{I} h(j)
$$

Where:
- $L$ = Total number of intensity levels.
- $N$ = Total number of pixels.
- $h(j)$ = Number of pixels with intensity $j$.
- $I'$ is the new intensity value after transformation.

### **Saturation Adjustment Formula**
To correct color loss, a new saturation $S'$ is computed as:

$$
S' = S \times k
$$

Where:
- $S'$ is the adjusted saturation.
- $S$ is the original saturation.
- $k$ is a scaling factor ($k > 1$ increases saturation, $k < 1$ decreases it).

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Histogram equalization** in **RGB space** leads to **color distortion**.
- **HSI-based equalization** preserves **color fidelity** by modifying only **intensity**.
- **Saturation enhancement** can **restore vibrancy** after intensity correction.
- **Automated contrast enhancement** is possible using this method.

# Color Image Smoothing and Sharpening

## **Overview**
Color image processing can be extended beyond individual pixel transformations by considering **neighborhood-based** operations such as **smoothing and sharpening**.

---

## **Color Image Smoothing**
Smoothing reduces noise and blurs details by averaging neighboring pixel values.

### **Neighborhood Averaging in RGB Space**
Averaging is applied to each component (R, G, and B) separately:

$$
c(x,y) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{(s,t) \in S_{xy}} c(s,t)
$$

Where:
- $S_{xy}$ is the set of neighboring pixels around $(x,y)$.
- $K$ is the total number of pixels in the neighborhood.
- $c(x,y)$ represents the RGB vector at $(x,y)$.

Since vector addition applies separately to each channel, the result is equivalent to applying smoothing **individually to each color plane**.

### **Example 6.12: RGB Smoothing vs. HSI Smoothing**
1. **RGB Smoothing**:
   - Each of the **Red, Green, and Blue components** is smoothed separately.
   - The final image is obtained by **combining the smoothed components**.

2. **HSI Smoothing**:
   - Only the **Intensity (I) component** is smoothed.
   - The **Hue (H) and Saturation (S) components remain unchanged**.
   - The result is converted back to **RGB for display**.

### **Comparison**
- In **RGB smoothing**, colors blend more because entire RGB vectors are averaged.
- In **HSI smoothing**, the structure is preserved better, and only brightness changes.
- **Larger kernel sizes amplify these differences.**

---

## **Color Image Sharpening**
Sharpening enhances image details using **the Laplacian operator**:

$$
\nabla^2 c(x,y) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla^2 R(x,y) \\
\nabla^2 G(x,y) \\
\nabla^2 B(x,y)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### **Laplacian Sharpening**
- The Laplacian of an image is computed using:

$$
\nabla^2 f(x,y) = \sum_{(s,t) \in S} w(s,t) f(x+s, y+t)
$$

where $w(s,t)$ is the **Laplacian kernel**.

- The result is **added back to the original image** to enhance edges:

$$
f_{\text{sharpened}}(x,y) = f(x,y) + k \nabla^2 f(x,y)
$$

where $k$ controls the sharpening strength.

### **Example 6.13: RGB vs. HSI Sharpening**
1. **RGB Sharpening**
   - The Laplacian is applied **independently** to **each RGB channel**.
   - The sharpened color image is reconstructed from the processed components.

2. **HSI Sharpening**
   - The Laplacian is applied **only to the intensity (I) component**.
   - The **Hue (H) and Saturation (S) remain unchanged**.
   - The modified intensity component is **converted back to RGB**.

### **Comparison**
- **RGB sharpening** modifies all color components, sometimes leading to unwanted color shifts.
- **HSI sharpening** enhances details **without altering color perception**.
- The **difference between these methods increases** with stronger sharpening.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Smoothing and sharpening operations** can be applied to **each RGB component separately** or just to the **intensity in HSI space**.
- **RGB smoothing/sharpening** blends and sharpens colors **simultaneously**.
- **HSI smoothing/sharpening** modifies only brightness, preserving **hue and saturation**.
- **HSI-based processing** often results in **more natural-looking images**.

# Using Color in Image Segmentation

## Segmentation in HSI Color Space

- **HSI color space** is often used for color-based segmentation because:
  - Hue represents color directly.
  - Saturation can be used as a mask.
  - Intensity is less useful as it contains no color information.

### Example 6.14: Segmenting a Color Image in HSI Space
- Objective: Segment a **reddish** region in an image.
- Steps:
  1. Convert the image to **HSI color space**.
  2. Observe that the **hue** values for the reddish region are high.
  3. Create a **binary mask** by thresholding the **saturation** channel.
  4. Multiply the **mask** with the **hue** image.
  5. Compute the **histogram** of the product image.
  6. Apply a threshold (e.g., 0.9) to isolate the reddish components.
- **Limitation:** Some reddish regions may be missed.

## Segmentation in RGB Space

- **RGB space** often gives better segmentation results because:
  - It directly represents colors as vectors in a 3D space.
  - Three color components (**R, G, B**) are used instead of just one (**hue**).

### Distance-Based Segmentation
- The similarity of a pixel **z** to a reference color **a** can be measured using:
  - **Euclidean Distance**:
    $$
    D(z, a) = \sqrt{(R_z - R_a)^2 + (G_z - G_a)^2 + (B_z - B_a)^2}
    $$
    - Pixels within a **sphere** of radius \(D_0\) around **a** are considered similar.
  
  - **Mahalanobis Distance**:
    $$
    D(z, a) = (z - a)^T C^{-1} (z - a)
    $$
    - Uses the **covariance matrix** \(C\) for better segmentation.
    - Defines an **ellipsoid** instead of a sphere.

  - **Bounding Box Approach**:
    - Instead of computing distances, a **rectangular region** is defined using the standard deviations of **R, G, B** values.

### Example 6.15: Color Segmentation in RGB Space
- Objective: Segment the same **reddish** region as in Example 6.14.
- Steps:
  1. Select a **sample region** containing the desired colors.
  2. Compute the **mean color vector** \(a\).
  3. Compute the **standard deviation** of each RGB component.
  4. Define a **bounding box**:
     $$
     [a_R - 1.25\sigma_R, a_R + 1.25\sigma_R]
     $$
     - Similar bounds are set for **G** and **B**.
  5. Pixels inside the bounding box are marked as **white**, others as **black**.
- **Result**: More accurate segmentation compared to **HSI-based segmentation**.

## Conclusion
- **HSI segmentation** is intuitive but **loses color information** by using only the hue.
- **RGB segmentation** gives better results by considering **all three color channels**.
- **Mahalanobis distance** and **bounding box** methods provide **efficient and accurate** segmentation.

# Color Edge Detection

## Introduction  
- Edge detection is essential for **image segmentation**.  
- This section focuses on computing edges on **individual component images**, rather than directly in **color vector space**.  
- Edge detection using **gradient operators** was introduced in **Section 3.6 (Image Sharpening)**.  
- However, the standard gradient is **not defined for vector quantities**.  
- Applying gradients to individual images and then combining them into a color image can **yield erroneous results**.  

## Issue with Component-wise Edge Detection  
- Consider two **M×M color images** (M is odd), as shown in **Figures 6.43(d) and (h)**.  
- These images are composed of three component images:  
  - **Figs. 6.43(a)-(c):** Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B) components of one image.  
  - **Figs. 6.43(e)-(g):** R, G, and B components of another image.  
- If the gradient is computed for each **RGB component** and then combined:  
  - The **gradient value at a specific point** remains the same in both images.  
  - However, **intuitively**, the gradient should be **stronger** in **Fig. 6.43(d)** where all **R, G, and B edges align**.  
  - In **Fig. 6.43(h)**, only **two edges align**, leading to weaker edge detection.  
- **Conclusion:** The standard method **fails to capture color vector information accurately**.  

## Di Zenzo’s Color Gradient Method  
- To define the **gradient magnitude and direction** in RGB **vector space**, Di Zenzo (1986) proposed a new approach.  
- Standard gradient methods work for **scalar functions**, but not for **vector functions**.  
- The gradient should indicate the **maximum rate of change** of **c(x, y)** at any point (x, y).  

### Gradient Computation  
Let **r, g, b** be unit vectors along the **R, G, B axes** in RGB color space. Define:  
$$
u = \frac{\partial R}{\partial x} r + \frac{\partial G}{\partial x} g + \frac{\partial B}{\partial x} b
$$
$$
v = \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} r + \frac{\partial G}{\partial y} g + \frac{\partial B}{\partial y} b
$$

Using **dot products**, define the following quantities:  
$$
g_{xx} = u \cdot u = \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial B}{\partial x} \right)^2
$$
$$
g_{yy} = v \cdot v = \left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial y} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial B}{\partial y} \right)^2
$$
$$
g_{xy} = u \cdot v = \frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \frac{\partial R}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial G}{\partial x} \frac{\partial G}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial B}{\partial x} \frac{\partial B}{\partial y}
$$

### Direction of Maximum Change  
- The direction **θ** of the maximum rate of change is given by:  
$$
\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2 g_{xy}}{g_{xx} - g_{yy}}
$$

### Magnitude of the Gradient  
- The gradient magnitude **F(x, y)** in the direction of **θ** is:  
$$
F(x, y) = \left( \frac{g_{xx} + g_{yy}}{2} \right) + \sqrt{\left( \frac{g_{xx} - g_{yy}}{2} \right)^2 + g_{xy}^2}
$$

### Properties of the Color Gradient  
- The formula gives **two orthogonal directions** (90° apart).  
- **F(x, y) is maximum in one direction** and **minimum in the perpendicular direction**.  
- **Only angles in [0, π) need to be computed** due to symmetry.  

## Comparison with Sobel Edge Detection  
- Sobel operators (Section 3.6) can be used to compute partial derivatives.  
- Example 6.16 compares **vector gradient vs. component-wise gradient**:  
  - **Vector method (Fig. 6.44(b))** captures more edge details.  
  - **Component-wise method (Fig. 6.44(c))** misses certain edge details (e.g., right eye).  
  - **Difference image (Fig. 6.44(d))** highlights additional details captured by the vector method.  
- **Trade-off:**  
  - **Component-wise method** is computationally cheaper.  
  - **Vector method** provides **better edge detail**, but at a **higher computational cost**.  

## Conclusion  
- **Component-wise edge detection** can produce **acceptable results** for simple applications.  
- **Di Zenzo’s method** is better for **accurate edge detection** in color images.  
- The choice depends on **accuracy requirements** and **computational constraints**.

# Noise in Color Images

The noise models discussed in **Section 5.2** apply to color images. However, noise can affect different **color channels** differently.  

## Causes of Uneven Noise in Color Images
1. **Hardware Malfunction:** A specific channel's electronics might fail.  
2. **Illumination Differences:**  
   - The strength of illumination available to each color channel varies.  
   - Example: A **red filter** on a CCD camera reduces red light detection, making the **red channel noisier**.  
   - CCD sensors have **higher noise at lower illumination levels**.  

## Effects of Noise on RGB to HSI Conversion
- **Additive Gaussian Noise** in RGB images is **less noticeable** than in grayscale images.  
- **HSI components degrade differently** due to **nonlinear transformations** (cos and min operations).  
- The **intensity component is smoother** since it is the **average of R, G, and B** (image averaging reduces noise).  

### Example: Gaussian Noise in RGB  
- **RGB Image Corruption:**  
  - Fine-grain noise is less noticeable in RGB than grayscale.  
  - Each component (R, G, B) is affected independently.  
- **HSI Conversion Impact:**  
  - **Hue and Saturation degrade significantly** due to nonlinear transformations.  
  - **Intensity appears smoother** because it is computed as:  
    $$
    I = \frac{R + G + B}{3}
    $$

### Example: Salt-and-Pepper Noise in One Channel
- If **only one channel (e.g., Green) is affected**, conversion to **HSI spreads the noise** across all components.  
- This happens because **HSI computation uses all three RGB components**.

## Filtering Noise in Color Images
- **Averaging filters** work **similarly in color vector space** and on individual channels.  
- **Order statistics filters (e.g., median filter)** require a **vector ordering scheme**, which is **complex** compared to scalar filtering.  
- For details on **vector ordering methods**, see **Plataniotis and Venetsanopoulos (2000)**.
