# 9.8 Grayscale Morphology

In this section, we extend basic morphological operations like dilation, erosion, opening, and closing to grayscale images. These operations are applied to grayscale images, denoted as $f(x, y)$, and structuring elements (SE), denoted as $b(x, y)$. Both are digital functions, where $f(x, y)$ represents a grayscale image and $b(x, y)$ represents a structuring element.

## Grayscale Morphological Operations

- **Dilation** and **erosion** in grayscale morphology perform similar functions to their binary counterparts, but instead of working with binary values (0 and 1), they work with intensity levels.
  
  - **Dilation**: The dilation of an image increases the intensity of pixels within the neighborhood defined by the structuring element.
  - **Erosion**: The erosion of an image decreases the intensity of pixels within the neighborhood defined by the structuring element.

- **Opening** and **Closing** are also extended to grayscale:
  - **Opening**: A sequence of erosion followed by dilation. It removes small-scale noise from the image.
  - **Closing**: A sequence of dilation followed by erosion. It fills small holes and gaps in the image.

## Grayscale Structuring Elements (SEs)

- **Nonflat Structuring Elements**: These are typically used for more advanced operations but are not commonly used in practice due to implementation complexities.
- **Flat Structuring Elements**: These are widely used and are symmetric in shape, such as disks. Their intensity profiles are also flat, hence the name. 

  - **Example**: A flat structuring element could be a disk, and its corresponding intensity profile would be flat, with the origin typically placed at the center.

### Example of Structuring Elements in Grayscale Morphology:
- **Hemispherical SE**: 
  - A nonflat SE used for specific image transformations.
  - It has a hemispherical shape, with the intensity profile showing a smooth gradient.
  
- **Flat Disk SE**:
  - A commonly used structuring element.
  - Its intensity profile is flat, meaning it has the same intensity across the entire element.

## Key Concepts:
- **Digital Functions**: $f(x, y)$ and $b(x, y)$ are digital functions where $f(x, y)$ represents an intensity value from a grayscale image, and $b(x, y)$ represents the structuring element used for morphological operations.
- **Grayscale Intensity**: The intensity values of the pixels in the image and the structuring elements are real numbers from the set of real numbers $R$, or integers from the set $Z$, depending on the system's implementation.
- **Reflection of SE**: The reflection of a structuring element is defined as in Section 9.1 and denoted as $\hat{b}(x, y)$.

## Conclusion

In grayscale morphology, structuring elements serve as "probes" that help examine the image for specific features. These operations extend the basic binary morphological operations and can be applied using both nonflat and flat structuring elements. However, flat structuring elements are more commonly used due to their simplicity and practical applicability.

# Grayscale Erosion and Dilation

In grayscale morphology, erosion and dilation are extended from binary operations to work with grayscale images. These operations use flat structuring elements (SE) and compute the minimum and maximum intensity values in the neighborhood defined by the structuring element.

### 1. Grayscale Erosion
Grayscale erosion of an image $f$ by a flat structuring element $b$ at a location $(x, y)$ is defined as the minimum value of the image in the region coincident with the structuring element, where the origin of the structuring element is at $(x, y)$. This operation is given by:

$$
f \ominus b(x, y) = \min_{(s,t) \in b} f(x+s, y+t)
$$

Here, $b$ is the structuring element, and the erosion operation computes the minimum intensity value of $f$ within the region defined by $b$. The process is applied by sliding the origin of $b$ over every pixel in the image, resulting in a new image where each pixel is the minimum intensity value in the region covered by the structuring element.

#### Example of Erosion:
If $b$ is a square structuring element of size $3 \times 3$, the erosion at a point requires finding the minimum intensity value of the 9 pixels contained within the region spanned by $b$ at that point.

The general result of grayscale erosion is that:
- The image tends to become darker.
- The sizes of bright features shrink.
- The sizes of dark features grow.

### 2. Grayscale Dilation
Grayscale dilation of an image $f$ by a flat structuring element $b$ at a location $(x, y)$ is defined as the maximum value of the image in the window spanned by the reflected structuring element $\hat{b}$, where the origin of $\hat{b}$ is at $(x, y)$. This operation is given by:

$$
f \oplus b(x, y) = \max_{(s,t) \in \hat{b}} f(x-s, y-t)
$$

Where $\hat{b}$ is the reflected version of $b$. The dilation operation computes the maximum intensity value of $f$ within the region defined by the reflected structuring element. This operation is applied by sliding the origin of $\hat{b}$ over every pixel in the image.

#### Example of Dilation:
The general result of grayscale dilation is the opposite of erosion:
- Bright features are thickened.
- The sizes of dark features are reduced.

### 3. Nonflat Structuring Elements
Nonflat structuring elements have grayscale values that vary over their domain of definition. These elements can cause significant variations in the results of erosion and dilation.

#### Erosion with Nonflat SE:
$$
f \ominus b_N(x, y) = \min_{(s,t) \in b_N} [f(x+s, y+t) - b_N(s, t)]
$$

#### Dilation with Nonflat SE:
$$
f \oplus b_N(x, y) = \max_{(s,t) \in b_N} [f(x-s, y-t) + b_N(s, t)]
$$

Erosion and dilation with nonflat structuring elements are more complex and computationally intensive. They are generally less used in practice because of difficulties in selecting appropriate elements and interpreting results.

### 4. Duality of Grayscale Erosion and Dilation
Grayscale erosion and dilation are dual operations with respect to complementation and reflection:

- **Complementation**: If $f_c(x, y) = 255 - f(x, y)$, then:
$$
  f \ominus b = (f_c \oplus b_c) \quad \text{and} \quad f \oplus b = (f_c \ominus b_c)
  $$

- **Reflection**: The operation of erosion or dilation is the same when the structuring element is reflected about its origin. This duality holds for both flat and nonflat structuring elements.

### 5. Grayscale Morphology in Practice
While grayscale erosion and dilation are important operations, they are often combined to form more powerful image processing algorithms. For instance:
- **Opening**: Erosion followed by dilation.
- **Closing**: Dilation followed by erosion.

These operations are useful for tasks like noise reduction, edge detection, and feature extraction.


# Grayscale Opening and Closing

Grayscale opening and closing operations are extensions of their binary counterparts and are used for removing or smoothing out small details in grayscale images. These operations involve the combination of erosion and dilation in sequence.

### 1. Grayscale Opening
The grayscale opening of an image $f$ by a structuring element $b$, denoted as $f \circ b$, is defined as the erosion of $f$ by $b$, followed by a dilation of the result by $b$:

$$
f \circ b = (f \ominus b) \oplus b
$$

Opening can be thought of as a process that "pushes" the structuring element up from below, against the undersurface of the image. The result is the highest value that the structuring element reaches when pushed against the image, essentially clipping the tops of the peaks in the image.

#### Geometric Interpretation:
If the intensity values of $f$ are treated as heights over a plane (3-D surface), opening removes small bright details (peaks) and leaves the larger structures largely undisturbed. The opening process effectively smooths the image by removing small bright features and making the overall structure cleaner.

### 2. Grayscale Closing
The grayscale closing of an image $f$ by a structuring element $b$, denoted as $f \bullet b$, is defined as the dilation of $f$ by $b$, followed by an erosion of the result by $b$:

$$
f \bullet b = (f \oplus b) \ominus b
$$

Closing can be interpreted geometrically as "pushing" the structuring element down onto the image, from above. The result is the lowest value reached by any part of the structuring element as it slides over the image.

#### Geometric Interpretation:
The closing operation smooths the dark features of the image by filling small holes and gaps, while leaving the larger dark features relatively intact. In terms of the intensity profile, closing fills small depressions (valleys) by pushing the structuring element down over the top of the image.

### 3. Duality of Opening and Closing
Opening and closing are dual operations with respect to complementation and reflection:

- **Opening**: $f \circ b = (f_c \bullet b_c)$
- **Closing**: $f \bullet b = (f_c \circ b_c)$

Where $f_c = 255 - f$ is the complement of the image, and $b_c$ is the reflected version of the structuring element.

### 4. Properties of Opening and Closing
Both operations satisfy the following properties:

#### Opening Properties:
- **Monotonicity**: If $f_1 \leq f_2$, then $f_1 \circ b \leq f_2 \circ b$.
- **Idempotence**: $f \circ b \circ b = f \circ b$.
- **Commutativity**: $f \circ b = b \circ f$.
  
#### Closing Properties:
- **Monotonicity**: If $f_1 \leq f_2$, then $f_1 \bullet b \leq f_2 \bullet b$.
- **Idempotence**: $f \bullet b \bullet b = f \bullet b$.
- **Commutativity**: $f \bullet b = b \bullet f$.

These properties ensure that opening and closing behave predictably and are useful for various image processing tasks such as noise removal, smoothing, and feature enhancement.

### 5. Example of Grayscale Opening and Closing
In the example from Figure 9.39:
- **Opening**: Using a disk structuring element of radius 3 pixels, the small bright features in the image were reduced in size, while the dark features remained largely unaffected. This is consistent with the idea of removing small, bright details.
  
- **Closing**: Using a larger disk (radius 5 pixels), small dark features (like holes or gaps) were filled, making the dark features more solid and connected. This operation had a smaller effect on the bright features, preserving their structure.

### Conclusion
Grayscale opening and closing are powerful tools for modifying the structure of an image by removing or smoothing small features. These operations help in feature extraction, noise reduction, and image enhancement tasks. By understanding their geometric interpretations and properties, you can effectively apply these operations to solve various image processing problems.

# Basic Grayscale Morphological Algorithms

## Morphological Smoothing
- **Opening** suppresses small bright details, leaving dark details relatively unaffected.
- **Closing** generally has the opposite effect, suppressing small dark details.
- These operations are combined to filter images for smoothing and noise removal.
- **Example**: 
  - *Figure 9.40*: An image of the Cygnus Loop supernova is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of opening and closing operations with different radii.
  - The results show how the noise is progressively removed as the size of the structuring element (SE) increases.

- **Alternating Sequential Filtering**: 
  - Involves performing the opening and closing operations sequentially, starting with the original image and then applying subsequent steps on the results.
  - This leads to more blurring compared to performing a single opening-then-closing operation.

## Morphological Gradient
- The **morphological gradient** of a grayscale image $f$ is computed by subtracting the result of erosion from dilation:
$$g(f) = dilation(f, b) - erosion(f, b)$$
- **Effect**: 
- Dilation thickens regions, erosion shrinks them, and their difference emphasizes the boundaries between regions.
- Homogeneous areas are suppressed, and the image produces a "derivative-like" effect.
- **Example**:
- *Figure 9.41*: A head CT scan is processed with dilation, erosion, and morphological gradient. The boundaries between regions are clearly delineated.

## Top-Hat and Bottom-Hat Transformations
- **Top-hat transformation**: 
- The difference between the original image and its opening:
  $$
  T(f) = f - opening(f, b)
  $$
- **Bottom-hat transformation**: 
- The difference between the closing of the image and the original image:
  $$
  B(f) = closing(f, b) - f
  $$

- **Applications**:
- Used to remove objects or enhance certain features by applying opening or closing with a structuring element that doesn't fit the objects.
- **White top-hat**: Applied for light objects on a dark background.
- **Black top-hat**: Applied for dark objects on a light background.

- **Example**:
- *Figure 9.42*: Using top-hat transformation for correcting nonuniform illumination in an image of rice grains.

## Granulometry
- Granulometry involves determining the size distribution of particles in an image.
- **Procedure**:
1. Apply openings with increasing structuring element (SE) sizes.
2. For each image resulting from the opening, compute the sum of pixel values (surface area).
3. As SE size increases, the sum decreases, and the differences between adjacent sums are plotted.
4. Peaks in the plot correspond to predominant particle sizes.

- **Example**:
- *Figure 9.43*: An image of wood dowels shows how granulometry identifies two distinct particle sizes by plotting the difference array of pixel sums from opening operations.

## Textural Segmentation
- **Segmentation**: The process of partitioning an image into regions, typically based on textural content (size, distribution, etc.).
- **Example**:
- *Figure 9.45*: A noisy image with large and small dark blobs on a light background is segmented based on the sizes of the blobs:
  1. **Closing** removes smaller blobs.
  2. **Opening** eliminates light patches between large blobs.
  3. **Morphological Gradient** identifies boundaries between regions based on textural features.

- The result helps distinguish regions based on their texture, such as large versus small blobs.
