# SIGNATURES

A signature is a 1-D functional representation of a 2-D boundary and can be generated in various ways. One common method is plotting the distance from the centroid to the boundary as a function of angle, as shown in Fig. 11.10. The main idea is to reduce the boundary representation to a 1-D function, which is presumably easier to describe than the original 2-D boundary.

## Normalization
- To normalize for size, we scale all functions to always span the same range, e.g., [0, 1]. 
- This method is simple but can introduce errors if shapes are noisy, as scaling depends only on the minimum and maximum values.
- A more rugged approach divides each sample by the variance of the signature, which adjusts for changes in size while preserving the fundamental shape. The variance approach works like automatic volume control.

## Other Signature Approaches
1. **Tangent Angle Signature**: This method traverses the boundary and plots the angle between a line tangent to the boundary and a reference line. The resulting signature reflects basic shape characteristics. For example:
   - Horizontal segments correspond to straight lines.
   - Sharp changes in angle correspond to corners or other sharp inflections.
   
2. **Slope Density Function**: This is a histogram of tangent-angle values. It responds strongly to straight or nearly straight boundary segments and shows deep valleys for sections with rapidly varying angles (e.g., corners).

## Example 11.4: Signatures of Two Regions
- Figures 11.11(a) and (d) show two binary objects, and Figs. 11.11(b) and (e) are their boundaries.
- The corresponding signatures in Figs. 11.11(c) and (f) range from 0° to 360° in increments of 1°. 
- The number of prominent peaks in the signatures helps differentiate between the shapes of the two objects.

# SKELETONS, MEDIAL AXES, AND DISTANCE TRANSFORMS

Skeletons are related to the shape of a region and can be computed from a boundary by filling the enclosed area with foreground values, treating the result as a binary region. A skeleton reduces a region to a tree or graph, consisting of points that are equidistant from the region's boundary.

## Methods of Computing Skeletons
1. **Topology-Preserving Thinning**: This involves successively thinning the region (e.g., using morphological erosion) while preserving endpoints and line connectivity.
   
2. **Medial Axis Transform (MAT)**: The MAT computes the medial axis of a region by finding the closest points in the region to the boundary. If a point has more than one closest neighbor, it belongs to the medial axis. The concept of "closest" depends on the distance metric used.

   - The **prairie fire analogy**: If you consider a region as dry grass, lighting fires on the border, the MAT is the set of points where multiple fire fronts meet at the same time.
   
   - The MAT is computationally expensive because it requires calculating the distance from every interior point to every boundary point, making it impractical in most applications.

   - An alternative approach is to compute the skeleton using the **distance transform**, which has efficient algorithms.

## Distance Transform
- The distance transform of a region computes the distance from each pixel to the nearest nonzero-valued pixel (the boundary).
- For skeleton extraction, the distance transform is computed on the complement of the image. The resulting ridge (set of local maxima) corresponds to the skeleton.

## Example 11.5: Skeletons using Thinning vs Distance Transform
- **Figure 11.14(a)** shows a segmented image of blood vessels, and **Fig. 11.14(b)** shows the skeleton obtained using morphological thinning. Thinning is prone to spurs, as seen in the image.
- **Figure 11.14(c)** shows the result of pruning, which cleaned up the skeleton but lost some features.
- **Figure 11.14(d)** shows the skeleton obtained using the distance transform. This method automatically handles ambiguities like spurs and produces a cleaner skeleton with fewer discontinuities.
  
## Efficiency of Distance Transform
- Computing the distance transform efficiently has been a major research topic, with algorithms achieving linear time complexity, O(K), where K is the number of pixels.
- The algorithm by Maurer et al. [2003] computes the distance transform in **O(K)** time and can also be parallelized to O(K/P) using P processors.


# EXAMPLE 11.6: Using Slope Chain Codes to Describe Tortuosity

An important measure of blood vessel morphology is **tortuosity**, which can assist in the computer-aided diagnosis of **Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)**. ROP is an eye disease affecting premature babies, causing abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, which can lead to retina detachment and potentially blindness.

## ROP and Tortuosity
- ROP causes dilatation and increased tortuosity of retinal blood vessels, which are signs of highly probable ROP.
- Ophthalmologists diagnose and make initial treatment decisions based on the appearance of retinal blood vessels.
  
## The Example Setup
- **Figure 11.15(a)** shows a **fundus image** of the retina of a newborn baby affected by ROP.
- **Vessels A, B, and C** are selected to demonstrate the potential of **Slope Chain Codes (SCCs)** in quantifying tortuosity.
- The border of each vessel was extracted, and its length (in pixels) was calculated.

## Normalization and Length Calculation
- To make SCC comparisons meaningful, each vessel boundary was normalized to have the same number of straight-line segments, denoted **m**.
- The length **L** of each line segment was computed as:
  - **L = P / m**
    - **P** is the total length (number of pixels) of the vessel boundary.
    - **m** is the number of straight-line segments.
- The number of elements of each SCC is **m - 1**.

## Tortuosity Calculation
- The **tortuosity** (**t**) of a curve represented by an SCC is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the chain elements. This is given by the equation:
  - **t = Σ |chain elements|**
  
## Results
- The table in **Figure 11.15(b)** shows the tortuosity values (**t**) for vessels A, B, and C based on 51 straight-line segments.
  - **Values of tortuosity** for vessels A, B, and C:
    - Vessel A: **2.3770**
    - Vessel B: **2.5132**
    - Vessel C: **1.6285**
- These values align with visual analysis, where:
  - **Vessel B** is the most tortuous, showing more twists and turns.
  - **Vessel C** is the least tortuous, with fewer twists and turns.

# Fourier Descriptors

## Introduction
- **Figure 11.18** shows a digital boundary in the **xy-plane**, consisting of **K points**.
- Starting at an arbitrary point **(x0, y0)**, coordinate pairs **(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xK, yK)** are encountered in traversing the boundary (e.g., counterclockwise).
- These coordinates can be expressed as:
  - **x(k) = xk**
  - **y(k) = yk**
- The boundary can be represented as a sequence of coordinates **s(k) = [x(k), y(k)]**, where **k = 0, 1, 2, ..., K-1**.
- Each coordinate pair can be treated as a complex number:
  - **s(k) = x(k) + jy(k)** (where **j** is the imaginary unit).

## Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- The **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** of **s(k)** is given by:
  - **a(u) = Σ s(k) e^(-j * 2πuk / K)**
    - for **u = 0, 1, 2, ..., K-1**.
  - **a(u)** are the **Fourier descriptors** of the boundary.
  
## Inverse Fourier Transform
- The inverse Fourier transform restores **s(k)** using the following formula:
  - **s(k) = Σ a(u) e^(j * 2πuk / K)**
    - for **k = 0, 1, 2, ..., K-1**.
  
## Approximation with P Descriptors
- Instead of using all Fourier coefficients, only the first **P** coefficients can be used:
  - **a(u) = 0 for u > P-1**.
- The result is an approximation of **s(k)**:
  - **ŝ(k) = Σ a(u) e^(j * 2πuk / P)**
    - for **k = 0, 1, 2, ..., K-1**.
  
## Low-Pass Filtering
- Deleting high-frequency coefficients is equivalent to filtering the transform with an **ideal lowpass filter**.
- This is implemented by centering the transform and multiplying it by **e^(-j * 2πuk / K)** before filtering.
- The number of points in the boundary and its inverse must be **even** to preserve symmetry when coefficients are removed.
  
## Example 11.8: Using Fourier Descriptors
- **Figure 11.19(a)**: Boundary of a human chromosome (2868 points).
- Fourier descriptors for this boundary were obtained and used to reconstruct the boundary with fewer descriptors.
  - **Figure 11.19(b)**: Reconstructed boundary using **1434** descriptors (50% of original).
  - **Figures 11.19(c) to (h)**: Boundaries reconstructed with **286, 144, 72, 36, 18, and 8 descriptors**, respectively.
  - **8 descriptors**: The shape is no longer recognizable, as major features are lost.
- **Key takeaway**: Only a small number of Fourier descriptors can capture the essential shape features of a boundary.

## Geometrical Invariance
- **Translation**: Shifting the boundary does not affect the Fourier descriptors, except for **u = 0**, which becomes a constant.
- **Rotation**: Rotating the boundary by an angle **u** affects the descriptors as follows:
  - **a(u) = a(u) * e^(ju)**
    - This means all Fourier coefficients are multiplied by a constant term **e^(ju)**.
  
## Starting Point Changes
- Changing the starting point of the sequence affects the descriptors differently:
  - The new sequence can be defined as:
    - **s(k) = [x(k), y(k)] + Δxy**
    - Where **Δxy = Δx + jΔy** is the translation.
- The Fourier transform of a constant is an **impulse** located at the origin.

## Table 11.1: Geometrical Transformations
- Summary of how **Fourier descriptors** are affected by **rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in the starting point**.
  
## Figure 11.19: Boundary Reconstruction
- **(a)** Boundary of a human chromosome (2868 points).
- **(b)** to **(h)**: Reconstructed boundaries with various percentages of Fourier descriptors (50%, 10%, 5%, etc.).
  - The boundaries in **(b)** to **(g)** retain the main shape features, while **(h)** (with only 8 descriptors) loses these features.

# SOME BASIC DESCRIPTORS

The major and minor axes of a region, as well as the idea of a bounding box, are as defined earlier for boundaries. 

- **Area of a region**: Defined as the number of pixels in the region.
- **Perimeter of a region**: Length of its boundary.

When area and perimeter are used as descriptors, they generally make sense only when they are normalized. A more frequent use of these two descriptors is in measuring **compactness** of a region, defined as the perimeter squared over the area:

$$
compactness = p^2 / A (Eq. 11-18)
$$


This is a dimensionless measure:
- **For a circle**, it is 4π (its minimum value).
- **For a square**, it is 16.

Another similar dimensionless measure is **circularity** (also called roundness), defined as:


$$
circularity = (4πA) / p^2 (Eq. 11-19)
$$

The value of this descriptor is:
- **For a circle**, 1 (its maximum value).
- **For a square**, π/4.

These two measures are independent of size, orientation, and translation.

### Effective Diameter
Defined as:
$$
d_e = √(4A/π) (Eq. 11-20)
$$



This is the diameter of a circle having the same area, **A**, as the region. This measure is neither dimensionless nor independent of region size but is independent of orientation and translation. It can be normalized for size by dividing it by the largest diameter expected in a given application.

### Eccentricity
The eccentricity of a region relative to an ellipse is defined as the eccentricity of an ellipse that has the same second central moments as the region. For 1-D, the second central moment is the variance. For 2-D discrete data, we have to consider the variance of each variable as well as the covariance between them. These are the components of the **covariance matrix**, estimated from samples:

$$


C = (1/K) Σ (z_k - z)(z_k - z)^T (Eq. 11-21)
$$

where:
- **z_k** is a 2-D vector whose elements are the two spatial coordinates of a point in the region.
- **K** is the total number of points.
- **z** is the mean vector:

$$z = (1/K) Σ z_k (Eq. 11-22)$$

The main diagonal elements of **C** are the variances of the coordinate values of the points in the region, and the off-diagonal elements are their covariances.

An ellipse oriented in the same direction as the principal axes of the region can be interpreted as the intersection of a 2-D Gaussian function with the xy-plane. The orientation of the axes of the ellipse are also in the direction of the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and the distances from the center of the ellipse to its intersection with its major and minor axes are equal to the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, respectively.

The **eccentricity** of an ellipse with the same second moments as the region is given by:

$$eccentricity = √(l2 / l1) - √(l1 / l2) (Eq. 11-23)$$

where:
- **l1** and **l2** are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (the variance along the principal axes).

For circular regions, **l1 = l2** and the eccentricity is 0. For a line, **l1 = 0** and the eccentricity is 1.

### Comparison of Feature Descriptors

Figure 11.22 shows values of the preceding descriptors for several region shapes. The values for the **circle** and **square** are close to their theoretical values, but digitizing introduces some error. The **eccentricity** of the **square** is exactly 0 because a square with no rotation aligns perfectly with the sampling grid.

Key observations:
- The **star** is less compact and less circular than other shapes.
- The **teardrop** region has the largest eccentricity, but it is harder to differentiate from the other shapes using compactness or circularity.

In feature space, the points for the **circle** and **square** are much closer than the points for the **star** and **teardrop**, making the latter less likely to be misclassified, even in the presence of noise.


# TOPOLOGICAL DESCRIPTORS

**Topology** is the study of properties of a figure that are unaffected by any deformation, provided that there is no tearing or joining of the figure (rubber-sheet distortions). For example:
- A region with **two holes** (Fig. 11.25(a)) will retain its number of holes even if stretched or rotated, but the number of holes could change if the region is torn or folded.
- Topological properties do not depend on the notion of **distance** or any properties implicitly based on distance.

### Topological Properties

1. **Number of Holes**:
   - A topological descriptor can be the number of holes in a region. This value remains invariant under stretching or rotation.

2. **Number of Connected Components**:
   - A region can be described by its **number of connected components**. For example, Fig. 11.25(b) shows a region with three connected components.

3. **Euler Number**:
   - The Euler number, **E**, is a topological property defined as:

$$E = C - H (Eq. 11-24)$$

Where:
- **C** is the number of connected components.
- **H** is the number of holes.

Example regions:
- Fig. 11.26 shows two regions: 
  - Region "A" has **Euler number 0** (1 connected component, 1 hole).
  - Region "B" has **Euler number -1** (1 connected component, 2 holes).

4. **Euler Formula for Polygonal Networks**:
- For polygonal networks, a region's structure can be analyzed with the Euler formula:

$$V - Q + F = C - H (Eq. 11-25)$$

Where:
- **V** is the number of vertices.
- **Q** is the number of edges.
- **F** is the number of faces.
- **C** is the number of connected components.
- **H** is the number of holes.

This can be simplified as:

$$V - Q + F = E (Eq. 11-26)$$
Example:
- A polygonal network in Fig. 11.27 has:
  - **7 vertices**, **11 edges**, **2 faces**, **1 connected region**, and **3 holes**.
- The Euler number is **-2** (7 - 11 + 2 = -2).

### Example: Extracting and Characterizing the Largest Feature in a Segmented Image

- **Image Details**:
- A 512x512, 8-bit image of **Washington, D.C.** taken by a NASA **LANDSAT satellite** in the near infrared band (Fig. 1.10).
- Goal: Segment the **river** using thresholding (manual threshold selection to demonstrate the segmentation).

- **Thresholding**:
- Fig. 11.28(b) shows the result of thresholding with the highest threshold before the river becomes a disconnected region.
- The image has **1591 connected components** (using 8-connectivity) and an **Euler number of 1552**, deducing the number of holes as **39**.

- **Largest Connected Component**:
- Fig. 11.28(c) shows the connected component with the largest number of pixels (8479), which corresponds to the river region.
- **Skeletonization** of the connected component (Fig. 11.28(d)) can be used to measure the length of branches in the river.
