# Preliminaries

Mathematical morphology uses set theory for image processing. In binary images, sets are elements in the 2-D integer space $Z^2$, where each element is a 2-D vector representing a foreground pixel. In grayscale images, sets are in $Z^3$, where two components represent pixel coordinates, and the third is the intensity value.

Morphological operations involve two types of pixel sets: objects and structuring elements (SEs). Objects are foreground pixels, and SEs can contain foreground, background, or "don't care" elements ($\times$), where the value of that element doesn't matter in processing.

Images are rectangular arrays, so sets are embedded in rectangular backgrounds. The image’s non-object pixels are assigned a background value. Structuring elements follow the same approach, but digital SEs may not have a background border, unlike digital images.

Reflection and translation are used in morphology with SEs:

- **Reflection**: The reflection of a set $B$ about its origin is:

  $$
  \hat{B} = \{-b \ | \ b \in B\}
  $$

  Reflection rotates $B$ by 180° around its origin.

- **Translation**: Translating a set $B$ by point $z = (z_1, z_2)$ is:

  $$
  B(z) = \{ b + z \ | \ b \in B \}
  $$

  This shifts $B$ over the image, performing set operations at each location.

### Example of Morphological Operations:

Consider a binary image $I$ with an object $A$ and a $3 \times 3$ SE. The steps for morphological operations are:

1. Start with a background-only image.
2. Slide $B$ over $I$.
3. If $B$ is entirely contained in $A$ at a position, mark it as a foreground pixel in the new image. If not, leave it as a background point.

When the origin of $B$ reaches the border of $A$, part of $B$ is no longer contained in $A$, eroding the boundary of $A$. The operation requires background padding based on the SE's size.

In morphological terminology, when we say "$B$ is contained in $A$," we mean that the foreground elements of $B$ must only overlap the foreground elements of $A$. This is important when $B$ contains background or don't care elements.

Further, we will extend these binary operations to grayscale images and SEs in later sections.

# Erosion and Dilation

# Erosion
Erosion is a fundamental morphological operation. It is defined as:

$$
A \ominus B = \{z \ | \ B \text{ translated by } z \text{ is contained in } A \}
$$

Where:
- $A$ is a set of foreground pixels.
- $B$ is a structuring element (SE).
- $z$ represents the foreground values (1’s).

In words, erosion involves translating the SE $B$ across the image and checking if it fits entirely within the foreground pixels $A$. The set of all possible locations $z$ where $B$ fits entirely inside $A$ forms the output of the erosion.

### Erosion in Images
In image processing, we deal with both foreground and background pixels, so the erosion of an image $I$ by a structuring element $B$ is:

$$
I \ominus B = \{ z \ | \ B \text{ translated by } z \text{ is contained in the foreground of } I \}
$$

This equation clarifies that erosion works with both foreground and background elements. The result is a new image, where the foreground is eroded based on the structuring element.

### Equivalent Definitions of Erosion
Erosion can also be defined equivalently as:

$$
A \ominus B = \{z \ | \ B \text{ translated by } z \text{ does not intersect with the background}\}
$$

This ensures that the structuring element fits entirely inside the foreground pixels and does not overlap with the background pixels.

### Example: Erosion of Objects
In Fig. 9.4, erosion reduces the boundary of object $A$. The structuring element $B$ is moved over the image, and the result is that portions of the object at the border are removed, making the object smaller.

Erosion can be controlled by the shape and size of the structuring element. For example, using a square SE erodes uniformly, while using an elongated SE results in a line.

### Erosion as a Filter
Erosion can also be viewed as a morphological filter. Smaller details that do not fit the structuring element are removed. For example, in Fig. 9.5, erosion removes narrow lines connecting components in a binary image. By changing the size of the SE, more or fewer details are removed.

### Morphological Filters
In future sections, erosion and dilation will be used in more complex filtering tasks where details smaller than the structuring element are filtered out (erosion) or larger features are enhanced (dilation).

# Dilation

## Definition of Dilation
Dilation is the reverse of erosion, and it "grows" or "thickens" objects in a binary image. The dilation of a set $A$ by a structuring element $B$ is defined as:

$$
A \oplus B = \{ z \ | \ {\hat{B}} \text{ translated by } z \text{ intersects with } A \}
$$

Where:
- $A$ is a set of foreground pixels.
- $B$ is a structuring element (SE), and ${\hat{B}}$ denotes the reflection of $B$ about its origin.
- $z$ is the displacement of $B$.

### Dilation Process
- The structuring element is flipped about its origin and translated across the set $A$.
- Dilation involves adding foreground pixels in the areas where the reflected SE intersects with $A$.
- The extent of thickening depends on the size and shape of the structuring element.

### Example: Dilation to Repair Broken Characters
Dilation can be used to fill gaps in broken objects. For example, in a binary image with broken characters, applying dilation with a suitable structuring element can bridge the gaps between broken parts, as shown in the example of repairing broken characters. The morphological method directly results in a binary image, unlike low-pass filtering, which may require additional thresholding.

## Duality of Erosion and Dilation
Erosion and dilation are dual operations with respect to set complementation and reflection. The duality is expressed as:

- Erosion of $A$ by $B$ is the complement of the dilation of the background of $A$ by $B$:

$$
A \ominus B = (A^c \oplus B)^{c}
$$

- Dilation of $A$ by $B$ is the complement of the erosion of the background of $A$ by $B$:

$$
A \oplus B = (A^c \ominus B)^{c}
$$

This duality is useful, especially when the structuring element is symmetric about its origin. In this case, you can compute the erosion by dilating the background of $A$ and complementing the result.

### Proof of Duality
To illustrate the duality, consider the definition of erosion and dilation:
- The erosion is the set of $z$ where $B$ fits inside $A$.
- The dilation is the set of $z$ where the reflected $B$ intersects $A$.

Using set complementation and reflection properties, we can establish the duality between erosion and dilation as shown in the mathematical proof.

---

### Summary of Dilation
- Dilation is used to "grow" or "thicken" objects in a binary image.
- The extent of dilation depends on the size and shape of the structuring element.
- Dilation is useful in applications like repairing broken parts of objects in an image.
- Erosion and dilation are duals of each other, where each operation is related to the complement of the other with respect to the background.
# Opening and Closing in Morphological Image Processing

## Definition of Opening and Closing
Opening and closing are morphological operations that combine dilation and erosion in specific sequences to achieve particular image processing effects:

- **Opening**: Smooths the contours of an object, breaks narrow connections, and removes thin protrusions. It is defined as:
  
  $$ A \circ B = (A \ominus B) \oplus B $$

  This means opening is the erosion of $A$ by $B$, followed by a dilation of the result by $B$.

- **Closing**: Smooths contours, but unlike opening, it fuses narrow breaks, fills long thin gulfs, and eliminates small holes in the contour. It is defined as:

  $$ A \bullet B = (A \oplus B) \ominus B $$

  This means closing is the dilation of $A$ by $B$, followed by an erosion of the result by $B$.

### Geometric Interpretation
- **Opening**: The opening of a set $A$ by structuring element $B$ can be thought of as the union of all translations of $B$ that fit entirely inside $A$. This process removes regions that are narrower than the structuring element, smoothing the contours and breaking narrow isthmuses.
  
  Mathematically:
  
  $$ A \circ B = \bigcup_{z} \{ B_z \mid B_z \subseteq A \} $$

  This smooths the boundaries of objects, breaking thin connections or protrusions.

- **Closing**: The closing of a set $A$ by structuring element $B$ is the complement of the union of all translations of $B$ that do not overlap $A$. This operation fills gaps and small holes, smoothing the contours from the outside.

  Mathematically:
  
  $$ A \bullet B = \left(\bigcup_{z} \{ B_z \mid B_z \cap A \neq \emptyset \} \right)^c $$

### Example of Morphological Opening and Closing
1. **Opening**:
   - The original object $A$ is eroded by $B$ to remove thin sections (like narrow bridges) or protrusions.
   - Then, dilation is applied to restore the object’s size, but small parts that were removed by erosion remain gone.
   - The opening smoothes object contours and eliminates thin parts.

2. **Closing**:
   - The original object $A$ is dilated by $B$ to fill small gaps and extend the object.
   - Then, erosion is applied to remove excess thickness added during dilation, effectively filling holes and connecting narrow breaks.
   - The closing smoothes object contours and joins broken parts.

### Duality
Opening and closing are duals of each other with respect to set complementation and reflection:

- **Duality of Opening**:

  $$ A \circ B = (A^c \bullet B)^c $$

- **Duality of Closing**:

  $$ A \bullet B = (A^c \circ B)^c $$

This property means that the operations can be switched between opening and closing by taking complements.

## Properties of Opening and Closing

### Properties of Opening:
1. **Subset Property**: $A \circ B \subseteq A$
2. **Monotonicity**: If $C \subseteq D$, then $C \circ B \subseteq D \circ B$
3. **Idempotence**: $(A \circ B) \circ B = A \circ B$

### Properties of Closing:
1. **Superset Property**: $A \subseteq A \bullet B$
2. **Monotonicity**: If $C \subseteq D$, then $C \bullet B \subseteq D \bullet B$
3. **Idempotence**: $(A \bullet B) \bullet B = A \bullet B$

These properties ensure that opening and closing are predictable operations that simplify after being applied once.

## Example: Using Opening and Closing for Morphological Filtering
Morphological operations like opening and closing can be used to filter binary images, removing noise while preserving the structure of important features. Here's an example applied to a fingerprint image:

- **Objective**: Remove noise from a fingerprint image while minimizing distortion of the ridges.
  
- **Step-by-Step Process**:
  1. **Opening**: The fingerprint image undergoes erosion, removing small white noise specks in the background. Then, dilation is applied to smooth the contours of the ridges. This step reduces noise but can create gaps between ridges.
  2. **Closing**: To restore the ridges and fill small gaps, the image undergoes closing, which first dilates and then erodes, effectively closing small holes between the ridges while smoothing the contours.

The final result is a clean fingerprint image with minimal noise, demonstrating the effectiveness of morphological opening and closing in image preprocessing.

---

### Conclusion
Opening and closing are crucial tools in morphological image processing for smoothing object contours, eliminating small noise, and filling gaps. They work by combining dilation and erosion in a sequence that removes or adds pixels depending on the operation. Understanding their duality and properties allows for effective image filtering and noise removal.


# Some Basic Morphological Algorithms

In this section, we explore various practical uses of morphological operations on binary images, primarily for shape representation and extraction of features. These techniques include boundary extraction, hole filling, connected components extraction, and others such as region filling, thinning, thickening, and pruning. 

## Boundary Extraction

- **Concept**: The boundary of a set $A$ of foreground pixels, denoted as $b(A)$, can be obtained by eroding $A$ by a structuring element $B$ and then performing a set difference between $A$ and its erosion.
  - Equation: $b(A) = A - (A \ominus B)$
  - **Illustration**: 
    - A simple binary object is eroded by a structuring element, and the boundary is formed by subtracting the eroded image from the original.
    - The boundary extraction is often one pixel thick when using a 3x3 structuring element.

## Hole Filling

- **Concept**: Holes in a binary image are regions of background pixels surrounded by foreground pixels. The goal is to fill these holes with foreground elements (1’s).
  - **Procedure**: 
    - Start with an array of zeros and set the pixels inside holes to 1.
    - Iteratively apply dilation followed by intersection with the complement of the image until no more changes occur.
    - This process is known as *conditional dilation*.
  - **Example**: A binary image with white circles containing black holes is processed to fill the holes, resulting in complete spheres without internal reflections.
  - **Equation**: 
    - $X_k = (X_{k-1} \oplus B) \cap I^c$ where $B$ is the symmetric structuring element.

## Extraction of Connected Components

- **Concept**: Extracting connected components involves identifying regions of foreground pixels that are connected. This is important for tasks like object recognition.
  - **Procedure**:
    - Start with a binary image where each connected component is assigned a foreground value of 1.
    - Use dilation iteratively, stopping when no further changes occur, to grow connected components.
  - **Equation**:
    $$X_k = (X_{k-1} \oplus B) \cap I$$
    - This method uses conditional dilation, but here the image complement $I^c$ is replaced by the image $I$ since we are focusing on foreground pixels.
  - **Example**: For detecting foreign objects in packaged food, connected components help identify significant objects like bone fragments in a chicken breast X-ray image. Thresholding separates foreground from background, and connected component extraction helps label and identify these objects.

## Summary of Key Concepts

- **Boundary extraction**: Helps identify the outer limits of foreground objects.
- **Hole filling**: Fills background regions enclosed by foreground pixels.
- **Connected components**: Helps identify individual connected regions in a binary image, useful for object detection and analysis.

These basic morphological operations form the foundation for more complex image processing tasks, especially in binary image analysis.
