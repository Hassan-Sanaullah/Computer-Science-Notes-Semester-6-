# The Canny Edge Detector

The Canny edge detector, developed by Canny in 1986, is a widely used edge detection algorithm with superior performance. It is based on three main objectives:

1. **Low Error Rate**: The algorithm must find all edges without false edges.
2. **Edge Localization**: Detected edges should be as close as possible to the true edges, with minimal error in location.
3. **Single Edge Point Response**: Each true edge should be detected as a single point, avoiding multiple edge detections for the same edge.

## Mathematical Basis

- Canny used **numerical optimization** with 1-D step edges corrupted by **additive white Gaussian noise** to approximate the optimal edge detector.
- The approximation is the **first derivative of a Gaussian**.
- **Gaussian function** in 2-D:
$$
G(x, y) = e^(-(x^2 + y^2)/(2*s^2))
$$

## Process

1. **Smoothing**: Smooth the image with a Gaussian filter.
  - Form a smoothed image, `f_s(x, y)` by convolving the original image with the Gaussian function.
  - Equation:
    $$
    f_s(x, y) = G(x, y) * f(x, y)
    $$

2. **Compute Gradient**:
  - Compute the gradient magnitude `M(x, y)` and the gradient direction `a(x, y)` using derivatives of the image.
  - Gradient magnitude equation:
    $$
    M(x, y) = âˆš(g_x(x, y)^2 + g_y(x, y)^2)
    $$
  - Gradient direction equation:
    $$
    a(x, y) = tan^(-1)(g_y(x, y)/g_x(x, y))
    $$

3. **Non-Maxima Suppression**:
  - Thin the edges by removing edge points that are not local maxima along the edge direction.
  - For each point, check its neighbors in the direction of the gradient. If the point is not a local maximum, suppress it.

4. **Double Thresholding**:
  - Apply two thresholds: a **low threshold** (TL) and a **high threshold** (TH). These thresholds help distinguish strong edges from weak edges.
  - **Hysteresis**: Weak edges connected to strong edges are kept, while unconnected weak edges are discarded.

## Steps in Canny Edge Detection

1. **Smooth** the input image with a Gaussian filter.
2. **Compute** the gradient magnitude and angle images.
3. **Apply** non-maxima suppression to thin the edges.
4. **Use** double thresholding and connectivity analysis to detect and link edges.

## Hysteresis Thresholding

- **g(x, y)NH**: Strong edges (greater than the high threshold).
- **g(x, y)NL**: Weak edges (greater than the low threshold but less than the high threshold).
- The final edge map is formed by linking weak edges to strong edges using connectivity analysis.

## Final Output

- The edges are typically one pixel thick. A final edge-thinning step can be applied to make the edges precisely one pixel wide.

## Practical Implementation

- **Gaussian Smoothing**: The 2-D Gaussian filter is separable into two 1-D filters. This reduces computation by performing convolutions in one direction at a time.
- **Gradient Computation**: Derivative filters are used for calculating the gradient in both x and y directions.

## Example Results

- **Comparison**: The Canny algorithm generally produces better results compared to other edge detectors, like the thresholded gradient and Marr-Hildreth methods.
- In images such as buildings and CT scans, the Canny algorithm detects edges more accurately, including finer details, while rejecting irrelevant features like roof tiles.

## Summary

- **Canny Edge Detector** provides high-quality edge detection with:
- Minimal false edges.
- Precise edge localization.
- Clear, single edge responses.
- The algorithm is more complex than simpler methods, but it offers superior performance in detecting continuous and clean edges.
# Global Processing Using the Hough Transform

The Hough Transform is used for detecting curves of a specified shape in unstructured environments where only edge maps are available.

## Key Concepts:
- **Problem Context**: Often, in edge detection, we don't have knowledge about individual objects. Instead, all pixels are candidates for linking, and we need to identify patterns based on global properties.
- **Goal**: Find subsets of points that lie on straight lines.

## Traditional Approach:
- Identify lines through every pair of points.
- Computationally expensive: This involves finding $\binom{n}{2}$ lines and performing comparisons for every point.

## Hough Transform:
- **Original Idea** (Hough, 1962): Instead of working directly in the image space, map points into a parameter space (also called the accumulator or $ab$-plane).
  
### Equation of a Line:
- **Slope-intercept form**: 
  $$
  y = ax + b
  $$
  - This equation is rewritten as:
    $$
    b = x \cdot a - y
    $$
  - For each point $(x_i, y_i)$, this represents a family of lines in the parameter space.

### The Hough Transform Approach:
- **Parameter space**: Consider the line equation in normal form:
  $$
  x \cos(u) + y \sin(u) = r
  $$
  where:
  - $u$ is the angle (parameter),
  - $r$ is the perpendicular distance from the origin.

  - **Range**: $-90^\circ \leq u \leq 90^\circ$ and $-D \leq r \leq D$, where $D$ is the maximum diagonal of the image.

### Computational Steps:
1. **Accumulator Cells**: Divide the parameter space into cells (a grid in $r, u$-space).
2. **Mapping Points**: For each edge point $(x_k, y_k)$, compute the corresponding $r$ and $u$ values.
3. **Voting**: Increment the accumulator cell corresponding to the calculated $(r, u)$ value.
4. **Colinearity**: After voting, cells with high values indicate lines in the image.

### Example of Using the Hough Transform:
- **Edge map**: Begin with a binary edge map.
- **Parameter Space**: Subdivide the $r, u$-space.
- **Accumulator Analysis**: Identify cells with the highest counts.
- **Line Grouping**: Analyze continuity and group points that lie on the same line.

### Computational Efficiency:
- The method's computational cost is linear in the number of edge points, as each point only requires updates in the accumulator.
  
## Example 10.11: Basic Hough Transform Properties
- **Edge Mapping**: Map points to sinusoidal curves in the $r, u$-space.
- **Collinearity Detection**: Intersections in parameter space reveal points that lie on the same line.
- **Reflective Adjacency**: The Hough Transform exhibits adjacency at the edges of the parameter space.

### Generalization:
- The Hough Transform can be extended to detect other shapes, such as circles or arbitrary curves.
- For example, detecting a circle involves solving for three parameters in a 3D accumulator space.

## Example 10.12: Using the Hough Transform for Edge Linking
- **Problem**: Detect two edges forming a runway in an aerial image.
- **Edge Map**: Use an edge detection algorithm (e.g., Canny).
- **Parameter Space**: Use $1^\circ$ increments for $u$ and one-pixel increments for $r$.
- **Result**: Identify the lines corresponding to the runway by selecting the accumulator cells with the highest counts and bridging gaps in the edge map.

### Applications:
- **Autonomous Navigation**: A vehicle uses the Hough Transform to detect runway edges based on the runway orientation and GPS data.
- **Global Processing**: The method is global as it considers the entire image, grouping lines by direction.

# The Basics of Intensity Thresholding

## Introduction
Intensity thresholding is a technique used for image segmentation, where the intensity histogram of an image is analyzed to separate objects from the background. This can be done using a threshold value (T), which divides the image into different regions.

## Global Thresholding
Global thresholding is used when a constant threshold is applied across the entire image. An image point is classified as an object if its intensity is greater than T, otherwise, it is classified as background. The segmented image, $g(x, y)$, can be described by:

$$
g(x, y) =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } f(x, y) > T \\
0 & \text{if } f(x, y) \leq T
\end{cases}
$$

### Variable Thresholding
When the threshold changes across the image, it is called variable thresholding or adaptive thresholding. In some cases, the threshold at each point is determined based on local image properties such as the average intensity of neighboring pixels.

### Multi-Level Thresholding
If the histogram has multiple modes, a multi-level thresholding approach is used. For example, an image with three modes would be segmented into three regions using two thresholds:

$$
g(x, y) =
\begin{cases} 
a & \text{if } f(x, y) > T_2 \\
b & \text{if } T_1 < f(x, y) \leq T_2 \\
c & \text{if } f(x, y) \leq T_1
\end{cases}
$$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are distinct intensity values, and $T_1$ and $T_2$ are threshold values.

## Factors Affecting Thresholding Success

1. **Separation between Peaks**: The further apart the histogram peaks are, the easier it is to segment the image.
2. **Noise**: Noise can broaden the histogram modes, making them difficult to separate.
3. **Object and Background Size**: The relative sizes of objects and background influence segmentation.
4. **Illumination Uniformity**: Uneven lighting can affect segmentation.
5. **Reflectance Uniformity**: Variations in reflectance properties of objects or background can make thresholding more difficult.

## The Role of Noise in Image Thresholding

### Noiseless Image
In a noise-free image, the histogram contains distinct modes that can be easily separated using a threshold.

### Noisy Image
As noise increases, the modes in the histogram broaden, making thresholding harder. For example, Gaussian noise with different standard deviations can affect the separation between modes, as shown in the following examples:

- **Low Noise**: The histogram modes remain separate.
- **High Noise**: The modes merge, making it impossible to find a clear threshold.

## The Role of Illumination and Reflectance in Thresholding

Changes in illumination or reflectance can significantly impact the histogram and segmentation. For example, nonuniform illumination can make it difficult to segment the image. In such cases, techniques like **shading correction** or **variable thresholding** can be used to improve segmentation.

### Solutions:
1. **Shading Correction**: Multiply the image by the inverse of the illumination pattern.
2. **Top-Hat Transformation**: A technique to correct for global shading patterns.
3. **Variable Thresholding**: Adapt the threshold based on local image properties.

## Basic Global Thresholding Algorithm

The following steps describe an iterative algorithm for estimating the optimal global threshold:

1. **Initial Threshold**: Select an initial estimate for the global threshold, $T$.
2. **Segmentation**: Segment the image based on the initial threshold.
3. **Compute Averages**: Calculate the mean intensity for both object and background regions.
4. **Update Threshold**: Set the new threshold as the average of the two means.
5. **Repeat**: Continue iterating until the difference between successive thresholds is smaller than a predefined value, $\Delta T$.

The algorithm converges when the threshold stabilizes, and it works best when the histogram has distinct peaks corresponding to object and background.

## Example of Global Thresholding

- **Original Image**: Figure 10.35(a)
- **Histogram**: Figure 10.35(b) shows a clear valley separating the object and background.
- **Thresholding Result**: After three iterations, the threshold is estimated as $T = 125$, and the segmentation result is perfect, as shown in Figure 10.35(c).

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Initial threshold = average intensity.
2. Iteratively calculate the means and update the threshold.
3. Final segmentation with $T = 125$ produces accurate results.
