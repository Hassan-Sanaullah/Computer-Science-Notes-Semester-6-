# Project Management and Strategy

## Why Project Managers Need to Understand Strategy

### 1. Expanding the Role of the Project Manager
- Historically, project management was focused on **planning and execution**, while strategy was left to senior management.
- **Modern view**: Project management is at the intersection of strategy and operations.
- Aaron Shenhar emphasizes that project managers should expand from just operational tasks to focus on achieving **business results** and **market success**.

### 2. Reasons for Understanding Strategy
- **Making Better Decisions**: Project managers need to understand the company's mission to make informed decisions. For example, whether to prioritize speed or cost in project delivery depends on the company's strategy.
- **Being Effective Project Advocates**: Project managers need to align projects with organizational goals. This alignment helps gain **support from senior management** and enables better communication with team members and stakeholders.

### 3. Mistakes of Project Managers Without Strategic Understanding
- Focusing on low-priority issues.
- Prioritizing immediate customers rather than the broader market and value chain.
- Overemphasizing technology that doesn’t fit the company’s strategy or customer needs.
- Trying to solve every customer problem, instead of focusing on the key issues (Pareto’s Law).
- Pursuing unnecessary perfection that doesn’t benefit the project or stakeholders.

## The Strategic Management Process

### 1. Overview of Strategic Management
- **Strategic management** is the process of defining where an organization wants to go and how it will get there.
- It involves assessing the current position and developing long-term plans that focus on **competing effectively** in the market.
- Two main aspects of strategic management:
  - Responding to **external environmental changes**.
  - Allocating **scarce internal resources** to improve competitive position.

### 2. The Importance of Strategy
- Strategy supports **consistency** and **integration** at every level of the organization, ensuring resources and efforts are directed toward **common goals**.
- The main purpose of strategy is to **achieve long-term success** and maintain the company's position in the market.

## Components of the Strategic Management Process

### 1. Mission, Goals, and Objectives
- **Mission** defines the organization’s overall purpose.
- **Goals** are broader targets within the mission.
- **Objectives** are specific, measurable targets that help achieve the goals.

### 2. Strategic Management Cycle
- **Mission** -> **Goals** -> **Objectives** -> **Strategies** -> **Projects for Implementation**

---

## Four Key Activities of the Strategic Management Process

### 1. Review and Define the Organizational Mission
- Mission statements should be specific and focus on the organization’s products, services, target customers, and geographical scope.
- A clear **mission statement** provides focus and guides decision-making.
- Mission statements rarely change, but they may be revised if the business shifts focus (e.g., Apple’s shift from PCs to music devices).

### 2. Set Long-Range Goals and Objectives
- Objectives break down the mission into actionable and measurable terms.
- Objectives should be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-related).
- Example: A company setting a 40% sales increase objective with R&D developing new luggage.
- **Cascading objectives**: Each department’s objectives should align with the organization's overall goals.
### SMART Objectives – Explained Notes

SMART is an acronym used to guide the setting of clear and achievable project objectives. Each letter represents a key characteristic that a good objective should have:

---

## S – Specific

- **Meaning:** The objective should be clearly defined and focused.
- **Explanation:** Avoid vague goals. Instead, state exactly what needs to be accomplished.
- **Example:** Instead of saying "Improve customer service", say "Reduce customer complaint response time to under 24 hours."

---

## M – Measurable

- **Meaning:** There should be a way to track and measure progress.
- **Explanation:** Use indicators or metrics to know whether you're moving towards the objective or not.
- **Example:** "Increase website traffic by 25% in 3 months."

---

## A – Assignable

- **Meaning:** The objective should be assigned to a specific individual or team.
- **Explanation:** Having a clear owner ensures responsibility and follow-through.
- **Example:** "The marketing team will launch the social media campaign by end of Q1."

---

## R – Realistic

- **Meaning:** The goal should be achievable with the given resources.
- **Explanation:** Consider constraints like budget, personnel, and time. Set goals that are challenging but possible.
- **Example:** "Hire 3 new developers in the next two months within the existing recruitment budget."

---

## T – Time-related (or Time-bound)

- **Meaning:** There must be a clear deadline or timeframe.
- **Explanation:** A time frame creates urgency and helps track progress.
- **Example:** "Complete the system migration by June 30."


### 3. Analyze and Formulate Strategies to Reach Objectives
- **SWOT Analysis**: Identify internal **strengths** and **weaknesses**, and external **opportunities** and **threats**.
- Use the SWOT analysis to create **strategic alternatives** and select the best one to meet organizational goals.
- **Critical questions** for strategy evaluation:
  - Does the strategy use core competencies?
  - Does it take advantage of competitive advantages?
  - Does it align with customer needs?

### 4. Implement Strategies through Projects
- **Implementation** answers the question of how to execute strategies with available resources.
- It requires:
  - Allocation of resources (funds, people, skills, etc.).
  - An organization structure that supports strategy.
  - Planning and control systems to ensure effective execution.
  - Motivating project contributors.
  - Prioritizing projects to ensure strategic alignment.
- Without proper implementation, even the best strategies fail.

---

## Summary
- **Project managers** must align their projects with the organization’s **strategic goals** to ensure project success.
- **Strategic management** involves defining the organization’s purpose, setting long-term goals, and using projects as the vehicle for strategy implementation.
- Successful project managers must balance both **technical** project execution and a **strategic understanding** of the business.
# The Need for an Effective Project Portfolio Management System

## Problems Due to Lack of a Strong Priority System  
Implementing projects without a structured priority system linked to strategy leads to three major problems:  

### **Problem 1: The Implementation Gap**  
- In many organizations, top management formulates strategy, while functional managers handle implementation.  
- Independent objectives and strategies by different functional groups create misalignment.  

**Symptoms of Strategy Disconnect:**  
- Conflicts among functional managers, leading to distrust.  
- Frequent meetings to renegotiate priorities.  
- Employees frequently shift between projects, causing confusion.  
- Multiple projects lead to inefficiency.  
- Inadequate resource allocation.  

**Effects of the Implementation Gap:**  
- Organizational dysfunction and ineffective strategy implementation.  
- Projects rated highly in one department may be low-priority in another.  
- Only **25% of Fortune 500 executives** believe their strategy and project implementation align.  
- **Deloitte study**: Only **23% of executives** considered project portfolios aligned with core business.  
- **Fusco’s research**:  
  - **24% of organizations** did not publish or circulate objectives.  
  - **40% of respondents** found unclear project priorities.  
  - Only **17% of respondents** reported clear priorities.  

### **Problem 2: Organization Politics**  
- Internal politics influence which projects get funded, especially when selection criteria are unclear.  
- Project selection can be driven by power rather than strategic alignment.  

**Example: The "Sacred Cow" Effect**  
- Projects backed by high-ranking officials often bypass objective evaluation.  
- Example: A consultant’s market analysis showed insufficient demand for a product, but the report was buried because it was the CEO’s "pet project."  

**Role of Project Sponsors:**  
- High-ranking managers provide political support to ensure project success.  
- Important in securing project approval and overcoming internal resistance.  
- Example: **Xerox ALTO computer (1970s)**  
  - Technologically ahead of competitors (first mouse, laser printer, LAN).  
  - Internal conflicts and lack of sponsorship led to failure in capitalizing on innovation.  

**Political Aspirations & Project Selection:**  
- Managing high-profile projects enhances career growth.  
- Example: **Lee Iacocca’s career** was built on leading the Ford Mustang project.  
- Top management should implement a system to reduce political influence in project selection.  

### **Problem 3: Resource Conflicts and Multitasking**  
- Organizations operate in **multiproject environments**, leading to resource sharing issues.  
- Example: A construction firm winning a new contract raises resource allocation concerns:  
  - Can existing labor meet deadlines?  
  - Will subcontracting help?  
  - Which projects will take priority?  

**Issues with Multitasking:**  
- Employees switching between multiple projects experience reduced efficiency.  
- Increased delays and costs due to frequent switching.  
- More common in organizations with **too many projects for available resources**.  
- Typically, project demand exceeds available resources by **3-4 times**.  
- Lack of priority systems causes confusion and inefficient resource use.  
- **Employee morale suffers** due to unclear project selection and resource allocation.  

## **Need for a Project Portfolio System**  
Organizations must develop a structured process for project selection and prioritization to:  
- Reduce the **implementation gap** and align projects with strategic goals.  
- Minimize **power politics** in project selection.  
- Prioritize projects **consistently** to support strategic objectives.  
- Allocate scarce resources efficiently (people, equipment).  
- Encourage bottom-up project initiation based on clear targets.  

### **Benefits of a Project Portfolio System**  
- Builds **discipline** into project selection.  
- Links project selection to **strategic metrics**.  
- Prioritizes projects based on **objective criteria** rather than politics.  
- Ensures resources align with **strategic direction**.  
- Balances **risk** across projects.  
- Justifies **eliminating projects** that do not support strategy.  
- Improves **communication** and agreement on project goals.  

### **Conclusion**  
A **single-project priority system** that ranks projects by their contribution to strategic plans would streamline project selection and resource allocation. Organizations are shifting focus from managing projects **individually** to maintaining a **strategic project portfolio**, ensuring alignment with long-term goals.

# Project Portfolio Management System

## Purpose
- Ensures **strategic alignment** of projects and **proper prioritization**.
- Helps **make informed business decisions** on project selection.

## Steps in Project Portfolio Management

### 1. Classification of Projects
Projects are categorized into three types:
- **Compliance and Emergency (Must-Do) Projects**:
  - Required to meet regulations or urgent needs.
  - Example: Rebuilding a factory destroyed by fire.
- **Operational Projects**:
  - Improve efficiency, reduce costs, enhance performance.
  - Example: Total Quality Management (TQM) projects.
- **Strategic Projects**:
  - Support long-term organizational growth.
  - Example: Research and development (R&D), new product launches.

- **Rule for "Must-Do" projects:** 
  - 99% of stakeholders must agree that the project is necessary.
  - Other projects are selected based on **strategic alignment criteria**.

### 2. Project Selection Criteria
Selection criteria fall into two main categories:
- **Financial Criteria:**
  - Preferred method for evaluating projects.
  - Used when future cash flow estimates are reliable.
  - **Methods:**
    - **Payback Model:** Measures how long it takes to recover investment.
      - Formula:  
        $$
        \text{Payback Period (years)} = \frac{\text{Estimated Project Cost}}{\text{Annual Savings}}
        $$
      - **Example:**
        - Project A: \$700,000 investment, \$225,000 annual inflows → Payback = 3.1 years.
        - Project B: \$400,000 investment, \$110,000 annual inflows → Payback = 3.6 years.
      - **Limitations:** Ignores time value of money and long-term profitability.
    - **Net Present Value (NPV) Model:**  
      - Uses the **minimum desired rate of return** (discount rate) to compute present value of cash inflows.
      - Formula:  
        $$
        \text{NPV} = I_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{F_t}{(1 + k)^t}
        $$
        - $I_0$ = Initial investment (negative value).
        - $F_t$ = Net cash inflow in period $t$.
        - $k$ = Required rate of return.
      - **Interpretation:**  
        - **Positive NPV** → Project meets return expectations, considered for selection.
        - **Negative NPV** → Project is rejected.

- **Non-Financial Criteria:**
  - Used when financial data is uncertain or strategic goals outweigh financial returns.
  - Factors include:
    - Strategic fit (alignment with long-term goals).
    - Competitive advantage.
    - Market demand.
    - Risk level.
    - Core competency alignment.
    - Social/environmental impact.

### 3. Evaluating and Prioritizing Projects
- **Project Screening Matrix**:
  - Used to rank projects based on multiple criteria.
  - Steps:
    1. Assign **importance weights** to criteria (e.g., strategic fit, ROI).
    2. Score projects based on how well they meet each criterion.
    3. Multiply scores by their weights to calculate **total weighted scores**.
    4. Rank projects by their total scores.
    5. Set a cutoff threshold based on resource availability.
- **Example:**
  - If threshold = 50 points, projects below this score are eliminated.
  - **Highest-scoring projects** are given priority.

---

## Final Considerations
- **Selection models assist decision-making but do not make final decisions.**
- **Human judgment is essential** to account for factors models cannot capture.
- **Portfolio management should balance strategic alignment, financial viability, and resource availability.**

# Portfolio Management and Project Selection

## Portfolio of Projects

Portfolio management ensures that projects are **aligned with strategic goals** and **prioritized appropriately**. It helps in **better decision-making** by managing resources effectively. 

### Project Portfolio System Design
A project portfolio system should include:
- **Classification of projects**
- **Selection criteria** based on classification
- **Sources of proposals**
- **Evaluating proposals**
- **Managing the portfolio**

---

## Classification of Projects

Organizations typically classify projects into three types:

1. **Compliance and Emergency (Must Do) Projects**  
   - Required to meet **regulatory conditions**.  
   - Example: Installing a **pollution control filter** to comply with regulations.  
   - Often **mandatory** to avoid penalties or failure.

2. **Operational Projects**  
   - Improve **efficiency**, reduce costs, and enhance performance.  
   - Example: **Total Quality Management (TQM) initiatives**.

3. **Strategic Projects**  
   - Directly support **long-term mission and revenue growth**.  
   - Examples: **New product development, research, and expansion initiatives**.

> **Rule of thumb**: Compliance projects are mandatory if **99% of stakeholders agree** on their necessity.

---

## Selection Criteria for Projects

### Financial Criteria  
1. **Payback Model**  
   - Measures the **time to recover investment**.  
   - Formula:  
     $$\text{Payback period (yrs)} = \frac{\text{Estimated Project Cost}}{\text{Annual Savings}}$$  
   - **Limitations**:  
     - Ignores **time value of money**.  
     - Does not account for profitability beyond the investment period.  
   - Example:  
     - **Project A**: Initial investment = **$700,000**, annual inflows = **$225,000**, payback = **3.1 years**.  
     - **Project B**: Initial investment = **$400,000**, annual inflows = **$110,000**, payback = **3.6 years**.

2. **Net Present Value (NPV) Model**  
   - Uses a **discount rate** to compute present value of cash inflows.  
   - Formula:  
     $$NPV = I_0 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{F_t}{(1+k)^t}$$  
     where:  
     - \(I_0\) = Initial investment  
     - \(F_t\) = Net cash inflow at period \(t\)  
     - \(k\) = Required rate of return  
   - **Higher NPV is better**.

---

## Project Screening and Prioritization

A **project screening matrix** helps in evaluating multiple projects using **weighted scoring models**.

### Steps in Project Selection:
1. Define **selection criteria** (e.g., ROI, strategic fit, urgency).
2. **Weight each criterion** (scale of 0-3).
3. Assign **project scores** based on fit to criteria.
4. Compute **total weighted score**.
5. Rank projects and **eliminate those below the cutoff**.

Example:  
- **Project 5** has the highest score (**102**) and is prioritized first.  
- **Project 2** has the lowest score (**27**) and is rejected.

> **Key Insight**: Selection models **guide** decisions but **do not replace human judgment**.

---

## Applying a Selection Model

### Classification and Model Selection
- **Project classification** determines the criteria used.  
- The **most important criterion** is **alignment with organizational strategy**.  
- **Weighted scoring models** ensure strategic alignment and **reduce wasteful projects**.

### Benefits of Weighted Scoring Models:
- Ensures **better resource utilization**.
- Reduces **political or unnecessary projects**.
- Helps **project managers understand** how their project contributes to strategic goals.

---

## Sources and Solicitation of Project Proposals

- **Project ideas** can come from **anyone**, including **internal and external sponsors**.
- Organizations may **issue an RFP (Request for Proposal)** for projects requiring **external expertise**.
- Example: A hospital issued an RFP for designing a **new high-tech operating room**.

### Project Proposal Form Example (Automatic Vehicular Tracking):
- **Sponsor**: J. Moran  
- **Problem Addressed**: Increase customer satisfaction and safety.  
- **Alignment with Strategy**: Increase ridership and accident response time.  
- **Major Risks**: Cost overruns, system integration, cybersecurity threats.  
- **Estimated Cost**: **$10 million**  
- **Project Duration**: **22 weeks**  

---

## Project Screening and Selection Process

### Ranking and Selecting Projects:
1. **Proposal Submission**
2. **Data Collection** (strategic fit, ROI, risks)
3. **Initial Evaluation**
   - **Reject if misaligned**.
   - **Request more information if unclear**.
4. **Project Priority Team Evaluation**
   - **Approve if aligned**.
   - **Hold if resources are unavailable**.
5. **Implementation and Monitoring**
   - Assign **priority, resources, and project manager**.
   - **Periodic reassessment** of priorities.

Example:  
- **Project 26** has **major impact on customer service** but **no effect on sales**.  
- Weighted scoring approach helps in **strategic prioritization**.

---

## Conclusion

1. **Portfolio management** ensures projects **align with strategy** and **maximize resource utilization**.
2. **Selection models** (payback, NPV, weighted scoring) help **prioritize projects** effectively.
3. **Soliciting proposals from diverse sources** improves innovation and decision-making.
4. **A structured screening process** prevents wasteful projects and optimizes resource allocation.
# Managing the Portfolio System

Managing the project portfolio involves continuously assessing the merits of a project within the context of the entire portfolio. This process also includes monitoring and adjusting selection criteria based on the organization’s strategic focus.

## Senior Management Input

1. **Guidance on Selection Criteria**:  
   Senior management provides input on establishing selection criteria that align with current organizational strategies.
   
2. **Balancing Resources**:  
   Senior management decides on the **balance of resources** (people and capital) to be allocated among different types of projects.  
   - Example: **20% compliance, 50% strategic, and 30% operational** before project selection.

---

## The Priority Team Responsibilities

1. **Publishing Project Priority**:  
   The priority team or project office is responsible for making the priority of every project clear and **transparent**.

2. **Open Communication**:  
   - Many organizations use **electronic bulletin boards** to display the **current project portfolio**, **project status**, and **issues**.
   - This transparency discourages power politics and promotes **openness**.

3. **Periodic Review**:  
   - The priority team **evaluates the progress** of ongoing projects.
   - **Environmental scanning** is essential to ensure the focus and selection criteria are still relevant to the changing external environment.

4. **Enforcing Priority System**:  
   - Ensuring that **all projects are evaluated** using the same criteria is essential.  
   - Regular updates about **approved projects**, **project ranks**, **current status**, and **changes in criteria** discourage bypassing the system.

---

## Balancing the Portfolio for Risks and Types of Projects

1. **Project Evaluation in Context**:  
   Each new project should be evaluated in terms of what it adds to the overall portfolio, **balancing short-term needs** and **long-term potential**.

2. **Resource Optimization**:  
   Resource usage must be balanced across **all projects**, not just the most important ones.

3. **Types of Risks**:  
   - **Portfolio Risk**: Reflects the organization’s risk profile and involves balancing risks across the entire portfolio (e.g., market risk, ability to execute, time to market, technology advances).
   - **Project-Specific Risks**: Risks like **schedule**, **cost**, and **technical** will be covered in **Chapter 7**.

---

## The Project Portfolio Matrix (Matheson’s Model)

David and Jim Matheson developed a matrix to assess a project portfolio, which divides projects into four categories based on **difficulty** (vertical axis) and **commercial potential** (horizontal axis).

### Categories in the Matrix:

1. **Bread and Butter Projects**  
   - Evolutionary improvements to current products and services.  
   - Examples: **Software upgrades**, **manufacturing cost reduction**.

2. **Pearls**  
   - Revolutionary commercial advances using **proven technology**.  
   - Examples: **Next-generation integrated circuit chips**, **sub-surface imaging for oil and gas**.

3. **Oysters**  
   - Technological breakthroughs with **high commercial payoff**.  
   - Examples: **Embryonic DNA treatments**, **new metal alloys**.

4. **White Elephants**  
   - Projects that once showed promise but are no longer viable.  
   - Examples: **Saturated market products**, **energy sources with toxic side effects**.

### Recommendations:
- Organizations often have too many **white elephants** and too few **pearls** and **oysters**.
- To maintain strategic advantage, focus on **pearls**, **eliminate or reposition white elephants**, and balance resources between **bread-and-butter** and **oyster projects** to align with the overall strategy.

---

## Conclusion

1. **Priority Team Responsibilities**:  
   The priority team is responsible for maintaining **openness**, **balancing risks**, and ensuring **alignment with strategic goals**.

2. **Balancing the Portfolio**:  
   Balancing **project types**, **risks**, and **resources** is crucial for long-term success.

3. **Matheson’s Model**:  
   The project portfolio matrix helps organizations assess the potential **commercial value** and **difficulty** of projects and decide where to focus their efforts.
