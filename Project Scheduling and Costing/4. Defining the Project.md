## Step 1: Defining the Project Scope

Defining the project scope is essential for developing a project plan. The project scope is a clear definition of the end result or mission of a project—a product or service for the client/customer. The primary purpose of defining scope is to clearly articulate the deliverables for the end user and to focus the project plans.

### Importance of Defining Scope
- **Poorly defined scope** is a frequent barrier to project success. 
- A study involving over 1,400 project managers in the U.S. and Canada found that **50% of planning problems** are related to unclear scope and goals.
- A **clear scope definition** strongly correlates with project success, as it directs focus on the project’s purpose throughout its lifecycle.

### Steps in Defining the Project Scope
- The project scope should be developed under the direction of the **project manager** and the **customer**.
- The project manager ensures agreement on project objectives, deliverables at each stage, and technical requirements.

### Scope Definition Document
- This document is published and used by the **project owner** and **participants** for planning and measuring project success.
- The scope should define what will be delivered to the customer in **specific**, **tangible**, and **measurable terms**.

### Project Scope Checklist
The following checklist can ensure that scope definition is complete:
1. **Project objective**
2. **Deliverables**
3. **Milestones**
4. **Technical requirements**
5. **Limits and exclusions**
6. **Reviews with customer**

#### 1. Project Objective
- Define the overall objective to meet customer needs.
- Example: A software company developing a program to translate English to Russian within three years, at a cost of $1.5 million.

#### 2. Deliverables
- Define major deliverables (outputs) during the project's lifecycle.
- Example: In the design phase, deliverables could be a list of specifications; in the second phase, it could be software coding and a technical manual.

#### 3. Milestones
- A milestone is a significant event in the project.
- The milestone schedule shows major segments of work, with rough-cut estimates for time, cost, and resources.
- Example: Testing complete by July 1.
- Milestones should be easy for all participants to recognize.

#### 4. Technical Requirements
- Define the technical requirements to ensure proper performance.
- Example: A technical requirement for a computer might be accepting 120-volt or 240-volt current.

#### 5. Limits and Exclusions
- Define the project’s scope boundaries to avoid false expectations.
- **Limits**: Define what is included (e.g., air transportation outsourced).
- **Exclusions**: Define what is not included (e.g., landscaping not part of house building).

#### 6. Reviews with Customer
- After defining scope, review with the customer to ensure understanding and agreement.
- Ensure the customer is getting the expected deliverables and all key project components (objectives, timing, performance, limits, exclusions) are covered.

### Project Scope Document
- Scope definition should be brief but complete (one or two pages for small projects).
- Different industries may use **unique templates** for scope definitions (e.g., Statement of Work (SOW) or Project Charter).

### Project Charter
- The **project charter** authorizes the project manager to initiate and lead the project.
- It grants the manager authority to use organizational resources for project activities.
- The charter often includes a brief scope description, risk limits, customer needs, spending limits, and team composition.

### Scope Creep
- **Scope creep** refers to the uncontrolled expansion of a project’s scope due to changing requirements or specifications over time.
- It can result in added costs and delays.
- Common examples include issues in large projects like the Denver airport baggage handling system or the Boston freeway system.

### Managing Scope Creep
- **Careful scope writing** can reduce scope creep.
- A scope statement that is too broad invites scope creep.
- Changes in requirements can result in cost overruns and delays.

### Change Control
- If project scope needs to change, a **change control process** should be in place to track and manage changes.
- The change log identifies the change, its impact, and who is responsible for accepting or rejecting changes.

## Step 2: Establishing Project Priorities

The success of a project is traditionally defined by meeting or exceeding the expectations of the customer or management in terms of **cost**, **time**, and **performance** (scope) (see Figure 4.1). These criteria are interrelated, meaning trade-offs may be necessary. For example, sometimes compromising on performance or scope is required to meet a project deadline or budget. Project managers need to manage these trade-offs effectively.

### Key Concepts of Project Priorities
- **Trade-offs**: Sometimes it is necessary to compromise on one criterion to achieve another. For example:
  - Reducing the project’s performance to meet a deadline.
  - Extending the project duration to reduce costs by using less expensive resources.
- The relationship between **cost** and **schedule** is not always straightforward. Longer durations can sometimes reduce costs, while speeding up the project can increase costs.

### Managing Trade-offs
A key responsibility of the project manager is to manage these trade-offs effectively, balancing time, cost, and performance. To do this, project managers need to:
1. **Define priorities** through discussions with the customer and upper management.
2. **Establish the relative importance** of each criterion (cost, time, and scope).

### The Priority Matrix
One useful technique for managing these trade-offs is creating a **priority matrix** that helps identify which criterion is constrained, enhanced, or accepted:
- **Constrain**: The project must meet a fixed parameter (e.g., schedule, cost, performance).
- **Enhance**: The project should optimize a specific criterion, such as reducing costs or shortening the schedule.
- **Accept**: Some flexibility is allowed on certain criteria. For example, the schedule can slip, or the scope and performance can be reduced.

### Example: Project Priority Matrix (Figure 4.2)
For a project developing a wireless modem, the priorities might be:
- **Constrain**: Performance specifications and reliability standards cannot be compromised.
- **Enhance**: The project manager should try to reduce completion time, even if it means going over budget.
- **Accept**: It is acceptable to exceed the budget slightly, but not by a large amount.

### Varying Priorities by Project Type
- **Software projects**: Time to market may be the most important criterion, even if it means deferring features to future versions (e.g., Microsoft).
- **Event-based projects**: For conferences or tournaments, time is constrained once the date is set, and scope may be reduced if the budget is tight.

### The Challenge of Balancing Priorities
While some argue that all three criteria (cost, time, and performance) should be optimized, in practice, project managers often need to make difficult decisions that benefit one criterion while compromising the others. These priorities need to be defined early in the project to guide decision-making when challenges arise.

### Limits and Documentation
- There are natural limits to how much any criterion can be adjusted. For example, the project may be allowed to slip by one month but no more, or it may exceed the budget by $20,000 but no further.
- These limits should be documented as part of the priority matrix to set clear boundaries for the project.

### Importance of the Priority Matrix
- **Before the project**: The matrix helps define and establish shared expectations with customers and top management.
- **Mid-project**: The matrix is useful for resolving problems and ensuring adjustments can be made to scope, schedule, and budget allocations.
- **Changing Priorities**: The project manager must be vigilant and adjust priorities if needed, such as responding to new customer demands or changes in management directives.

## Step 3: Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Once the project scope and deliverables are identified, the project work is subdivided into smaller, manageable work elements. The result of this process is called the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**. The WBS serves as a hierarchical map of the project and helps ensure that all products and work elements are identified, facilitating integration with the current organization and establishing a basis for control.

### Major Groupings in a WBS
The WBS is typically developed using hierarchical levels, where each level breaks down the project into smaller components. The major groupings in a WBS are as follows:

| Level  | Hierarchical Breakdown           | Description                                                |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Project                          | Complete project                                           |
| 2      | Deliverable                      | Major deliverables                                         |
| 3      | Subdeliverable                   | Supporting deliverables                                    |
| 4      | Lowest subdeliverable            | The lowest manageable element (work packages)              |
| 5      | Cost Account*                    | Grouping of work packages for monitoring and responsibility |

*Cost accounts are groupings of work packages by type of work within a deliverable. These help in assigning responsibilities to organizational units, aiding in monitoring project progress.*

### How the WBS Helps the Project Manager
- **Project Breakdown**: The WBS defines the entire project in a hierarchical framework, establishing the relationships between different elements of the project.
- **Cost, Time, and Performance Evaluation**: It facilitates the evaluation of costs, time, and technical performance at every level of the project.
- **Responsibility and Integration**: The WBS helps assign responsibility for each work package and integrates work with the organization.
- **Tracking and Monitoring**: The WBS allows the "rolling up" (summation) of smaller work packages into larger work elements, making it easier to monitor progress, costs, and performance.

### Work Packages
- The **lowest level of the WBS** is called a **work package**. Work packages are short-duration tasks with a definite start and stop point, they consume resources, and represent costs. Each work package is a **control point**.
- Work package managers are responsible for completing the work package on time, within budget, and according to technical specifications. 
- Ideally, a work package should not exceed 10 workdays. If it does, progress should be monitored regularly (e.g., every 3-5 days) to track any issues early.
- Work packages should be as independent as possible from other packages and should only appear in one subdeliverable.

### WBS Structure and Levels
- **Level 1**: The project itself, representing the overall goal or deliverable.
- **Level 2**: Major deliverables that need to be produced.
- **Level 3 and beyond**: Subdeliverables, which break down the project into smaller components.
- **Work Packages**: The lowest level, detailing specific tasks and responsibilities.

### Example: WBS for a Personal Computer Development Project (Figure 4.4)
At **Level 1**, the project is the personal computer prototype. **Level 2** shows the major deliverables, such as the disk storage unit, which includes components like external USB, optical, and hard disks. **Level 3** breaks these components further into subcomponents (e.g., motor, circuit board, chassis frame, and read/write head for the hard disk). **Level 4** and **Level 5** represent the smallest work packages that will be executed by the assigned organizational units.

### Differences Between Work Breakdown Subdeliverables and Work Packages
- **Work Breakdown Subdeliverables**: These include the outcomes of multiple work packages, and do not have a duration or cost directly associated with them.
- **Work Packages**: These are specific, short-duration tasks, and each has its own schedule, cost, resources, and responsibility.

### Work Package Characteristics
1. **Defines the work**: What tasks need to be completed.
2. **Time estimate**: How long the work will take.
3. **Cost estimate**: A time-phased budget for the work package.
4. **Resource requirements**: The amount and type of resources needed.
5. **Responsibility assignment**: Who is responsible for the work package.
6. **Monitoring points**: Milestones for tracking progress and performance.

### Creating a WBS from Scratch
- Developing a WBS can be challenging, so project managers should refer to past projects for guidance.
- For **small projects**, the entire project team might work together to break down the project into its components.
- For **large projects**, the individuals responsible for major deliverables will handle the first levels, and the details will be delegated to others.

### Important Considerations When Creating a WBS
- **Output-Oriented Focus**: The WBS should focus on deliverables and outputs, not organizational processes. Avoid structuring the WBS around departments or functions.
- **Avoid Process-Focus**: If the WBS is structured around functions like design, marketing, and production, it becomes more of an accounting tool for costs and is less effective for managing outputs.

## Step 4: Integrating the WBS with the Organization

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a key tool in linking organizational units responsible for performing project work. When integrated with the organization structure, the result is the **Organization Breakdown Structure (OBS)**. The OBS shows how the firm is organized to handle work responsibilities within the project.

### Purpose of the OBS
- **Summarizing Work Performance**: The OBS provides a framework to summarize how each organizational unit is performing its work.
- **Assigning Responsibility**: It identifies which organizational units are responsible for executing the work packages.
- **Cost Control**: The OBS ties organizational units to cost control accounts, enabling better budget and performance tracking.

### Integration of the WBS and OBS
The **OBS** helps break down the WBS by assigning organizational units to each work package. The intersection of the WBS and OBS creates a **project control point** or **cost account**, which integrates both the work and the responsibility for completing that work.

- **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**: Defines the tasks and deliverables.
- **OBS (Organization Breakdown Structure)**: Assigns organizational units to those tasks and deliverables.

The **intersection** of the WBS and OBS serves as a control point where the work and responsibility meet. This intersection allows project managers to manage the project both from the perspective of **deliverables (vertical)** and **responsibility (horizontal)**. 

For example, a work package such as designing a **circuit board** may involve multiple departments like **design**, **production**, **testing**, and **software**. The control point for this work package will represent these departments' responsibilities and progress, and the intersection will help in **tracking the outcomes** and **management responsibility**.

### Using the OBS and WBS Together
- **Vertical Tracking (Deliverables)**: Project progress can be tracked according to the completion of deliverables and subdeliverables, aligning with client interests.
- **Horizontal Tracking (Responsibility)**: Project progress can also be tracked horizontally by the organizational unit responsible for each work package, helping management track performance by department.

The integration of the WBS and OBS thus helps manage the project comprehensively by linking work to specific organizational units, ensuring both deliverables and responsibilities are clearly defined and monitored.

## Step 5: Coding the WBS for the Information System

To maximize the usefulness of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), a **coding system** is crucial. The WBS coding system is used to define the hierarchical levels and elements of the WBS, the organization elements, work packages, and budget and cost information. This system allows for the consolidation of reports at any level within the WBS structure.

### Numeric Indentation Coding Scheme
A common coding method is **numeric indentation**, where each level in the WBS corresponds to a numerical code. This structure helps represent the breakdown of tasks and elements, with each successive number representing a lower element or work package. An example is as follows:

- **1.0**: Computer Project
  - **1.1**: Disk Storage Units
    - **1.1.1**: External USB
    - **1.1.2**: Optical
    - **1.1.3**: Hard
      - **1.1.3.1**: Motor
      - **1.1.3.4**: Read/Write Head

Each level of the WBS has an associated numeric code. The **lowest manageable subdeliverables** are linked to **work packages**, and the project culminates in **cost accounts** that tie together all work, time, budget, and performance data.

### Flexibility in the Coding System
The coding system is flexible and can be expanded to suit large and complex projects:
- **Additional codes** can be added for special reports or to identify attributes like **site location** or **special accounts** (e.g., labor).
- The use of **letters** (e.g., "M" for materials, "E" for engineers) can help categorize specific elements.
- Numeric subdivisions can be extended beyond 10 (e.g., .1–.99 or .1–.9999) for larger projects.
  
For example, a complex project might use a code like **3R2237A2P2233.6**:
- **3R**: Facility
- **237A**: Elevation and Area
- **P2**: Pipe size (2 inches)
- **33.6**: Work package number

### Responsibility Matrices (RM)
In smaller projects or subprojects, a **Responsibility Matrix (RM)** is used instead of an elaborate WBS/OBS. The RM summarizes the tasks to be accomplished and who is responsible for each task. It clearly defines each team member’s role and the level of involvement in different activities.

#### Example: Market Research Project RM (Figure 4.6)
- **R** = Responsible (the person who coordinates and completes the task)
- **S** = Supports/assists (team members who help)

Example from a market research project:

| Task                     | Richard | Dan | Dave | Linda | Elizabeth |
|--------------------------|---------|-----|------|-------|-----------|
| Identify target customers | R       | S   | S    |       |           |
| Develop draft questionnaire | R     | S   | S    |       |           |
| Pilot-test questionnaire  | R       | S   |      |       |           |
| Finalize questionnaire    | R       | S   | S    | S     |           |

This RM helps organize responsibilities within the team and provides clarity on who is responsible for each task.

### Complex Responsibility Matrices
For larger projects, an RM can also clarify **critical interfaces** between units or individuals, indicating the need for coordination. The matrix may use **numeric codes** to define the type of involvement for each participant on specific tasks.

Example: Conveyor Belt Project RM (Figure 4.7)
- **1** = Responsible
- **2** = Support
- **3** = Consult
- **4** = Notification
- **5** = Approval

By using an RM, the relationship between organizational units and project work is made clear, improving communication and task coordination across the team.

### Key Takeaways
- A **WBS code** defines project hierarchy and allows easy tracking of work and cost.
- The **Responsibility Matrix** helps clarify roles and responsibilities for project tasks, making it an essential tool for smaller projects or subprojects.
- A **complex RM** ensures that roles, authority, and communication channels are well-defined for larger projects.
