## Boss vs. Leader

---
### 🔹 **Main Idea**

A **boss** manages work with authority.  
A **leader** inspires people to work with purpose.

Effective project managers act more like **leaders** than traditional bosses.

## Projects vs. Programs

### 📌 **Main Idea**

- A **project** is a single, temporary effort with a specific goal.
    
- A **program** is a collection of related projects **managed together** for better coordination and benefits.
    

---

## Managing vs Leading a Project

---

### 📌 **Basic Idea**

- A **Project Manager** does more than just follow a plan.
    
- They must handle unexpected issues, solve problems, and lead the team through **change**.
    
- This involves **both** **managing** (stability) **and** **leading** (change).
    

---

### 🧩 **Management = Coping with Complexity**

- Focus: **Stability and control**
    
- Tasks include:
    
    - Creating detailed plans and schedules
        
    - Organizing the project team
        
    - Tracking progress
        
    - Fixing issues and making trade-offs (time, cost, scope)
        
    - Ensuring tasks are done as planned
        

📍 Used most when:

- Projects are **routine** and **predictable**
    
- No big surprises occur
    
- Example: Building a standard apartment complex
    

---

### 🚀 **Leadership = Coping with Change**

- Focus: **Adapting to change, motivating people**
    
- Tasks include:
    
    - Identifying need for change
        
    - Adjusting project scope or direction
        
    - Aligning team with new goals
        
    - Inspiring and motivating the team to move forward
        
    - Handling breakdowns in coordination or design
        

📍 Used most when:

- Projects have **high uncertainty**
    
- Changes in technology, goals, or team dynamics happen
    
- Example: Leading a fast-changing **software project**
    

---

### 🔁 **Why Both Are Needed**

- Real-world projects rarely go 100% as planned
    
- Good project managers must:
    
    - **Manage**: Keep the work moving and stay organized
        
    - **Lead**: Adapt when things change and inspire the team
        

---

### 👥 **Not Everyone Can Do Both**

- Some are **strong leaders** but poor at details
    
- Some are **great organizers** but weak at motivating others
    
- Ideal project managers **combine both skills**
    

🧠 Smart teams may:

- Pair a visionary leader with a detail-focused manager
    
- Use assistants to fill in gaps in either role
    

---

## Managing Project Stakeholders

---

### 📌 **Why Stakeholders Matter**

- Projects don’t operate in isolation.
    
- Many people outside the direct project team **influence success**.
    
- Managing stakeholders is as important as managing the project team.
    

---

### 🧠 **What Project Managers Learn Quickly**

- Success depends on **many individuals who don’t report to them**.
    
- Time is spent:
    
    - Negotiating with **vendors, consultants, tech experts**
        
    - Coordinating with **other departments**
        
- This creates pressure and frustration, especially for first-time PMs.
    

---

### ⚠️ **The Trap of Micromanaging**

- New PMs may over-involve themselves to get things done fast.
    
- This leads to **micromanagement** and **burnout**.
    
- They eventually realize:
    
    - **Authority ≠ Influence**
        
    - Project success needs managing **complex relationships**, not just tasks.
        

---

### 🕸️ **The Stakeholder Web**

Projects involve:

#### 1. 🧑‍💻 **Core Project Team**

- Do the actual project work.
    
- Balancing this with personal/career goals.
    

#### 2. 🏢 **Internal Stakeholders**

- **Top Management**: Approves funding, sets priorities, defines success.
    
- **Functional Managers**: Control people/resources; want minimal disruption.
    
- **Other Project Managers**: Compete for resources.
    
- **Admin Support** (HR, Finance, IT): Supportive but impose formal constraints.
    

#### 3. 📦 **External Stakeholders**

- **Customers**: Define scope and judge success.
    
- **Project Sponsors**: Defend the project, use influence to push it forward.
    
- **Contractors/Subcontractors**: May do much or all of the work; balance own profits.
    
- **Government Agencies**: Enforce regulations, permits, codes (e.g., FDA, OSHA).
    
- **Suppliers**: Delays/quality issues can stall the project.
    
- **Public/Consultants**: Influence or oversee aspects like audits or compliance.
    

---

### 🔁 **Stakeholder Interdependence**

- PM’s success with one group affects others.
    
    - E.g., if **top management** is weakly supportive, **functional managers** may resist.
        
- Gaining trust from one group (like shielding the team from external pressure) improves reputation with others.
    

---

### 🏗️ **Project Structure Affects Stakeholder Management**

- **Dedicated Team**: Fewer external dependencies, easier control.
    
- **Matrix/Functional**: More dependencies, more coordination needed.
    

---

### 📣 **Modern View of Project Management**

|Old View|New View|
|---|---|
|Controlling subordinates|**Managing stakeholders**|
|Issuing instructions|**Anticipating change**|
|Focused on internal work|**Building cooperation across org and beyond**|

---
## Social Network Building

### Step 1: Map Dependencies

- Identify people crucial to project success. Ask:
    
    - Whose cooperation/approval do we need?
        
    - Who could block the project?
        
- Overestimate rather than underestimate dependencies.
    
- Step into their shoes:
    
    - What are their goals, values, pressures?
        
    - Do they support or oppose the project?
        
    - What is your relationship with them?
        
    - What influence/currency do you have?
        

**Goal:**  
Anticipate reactions, understand motivations, and select appropriate influence strategies.

---

**Example:**  
Project manager sensed resistance from Receipts Manager → listened, educated, accommodated his needs → smooth transition.

---

### 🚶 MBWA – Management by Wandering Around

- Stay out of the office, engage directly with team and stakeholders.
    
- Purposeful wandering to:
    
    - Monitor real progress.
        
    - Reinforce goals & vision.
        
    - Solve problems early.
        
    - Build cooperation.
        
- Don't rely on open-door policy — it favors only vocal team members.
    

**Pro Tip:**  
Keep in touch even with distant stakeholders (vendors, top managers, etc.) to build rapport and shape expectations early.

---

**Why It Matters:**

- Builds trust and credit.
    
- Prevents panic during future problems.
    
- Makes people more cooperative during conflict.
    

---

### 📈 Managing Upward Relations

**Why Top Management Support Is Critical:**

- Ensures:
    
    - Budget approval
        
    - Extra resources
        
    - Organizational cooperation
        
- Boosts team morale and motivation.
    

---

**Challenges with Upper Management:**

- PMs focus on project, top managers focus on organization.
    
- Conflicting priorities are **normal**, not personal.
    

---

**How to Influence Superiors:**

- Prove **loyalty first** by following through on requests and staying within boundaries.
    
- Build trust with **project sponsors** — keep them informed of potential issues.
    
- Time requests wisely (e.g., avoid budget asks after bad earnings reports).
    
- Learn their **language** and communication style (e.g., use metaphors they relate to).
    
- If necessary (and risky), some PMs take bold steps without asking — results must justify it.
    

---

### 🧭 Leading by Example

**Your behavior sets the tone. Teams mimic what they see.**

| Aspect                    | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Priorities**            | Actions show what truly matters. Spend time where you want others to focus.           |
| **Urgency**               | Use deadlines, reports, and faster pace to energize team. Increase interaction speed. |
| **Problem Solving**       | Focus on learning and fixing, not blaming. Encourages open communication.             |
| **Cooperation**           | Treat outsiders respectfully → team will too. Avoid gossip or ridicule.               |
| **Performance Standards** | Exceed expectations in your own work. Stay organized, responsive, and firm.           |
| **Ethics**                | Team will mirror your integrity. Don’t distort/hide information — it sets a bad tone. |
