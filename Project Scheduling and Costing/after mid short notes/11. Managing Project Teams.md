## Synergy in Managing Project Teams

---

### 🔄 What is Synergy?

- Derived from Greek word **“sunergos”** meaning _working together_.
    
- Describes how team interactions create **combined effects** beyond individual efforts.
    

---

### 📈 Types of Synergy

|Type|Meaning|Equation Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Positive Synergy**|Team output > sum of individual efforts|1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **10**|
|**Negative Synergy**|Team output < sum of individual efforts|1 + 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 = **2** (or worse)|

---

### 🏀 Real-World Analogy

- Seen clearly in sports teams (e.g., basketball, soccer):  
    **A united team can beat stronger opponents.**
    
- In projects, synergy is less visible but just as powerful or destructive.
    

---

### ❌ Example of Negative Synergy (Team Breakdown)

- Team split into subgroups (e.g., marketing vs. systems).
    
- Time wasted on gossip, blame-shifting, and avoiding responsibility.
    
- Communication broke down — shifted to impersonal emails.
    
- Project failed and had to be restarted with a new team.
    

---

### ✅ Example of Positive Synergy (High-Performing Team)

- Team shared excitement and commitment.
    
- Faced challenges directly and supported one another.
    
- Encouraged and pushed each other to perform better.
    
- Result: **One of the most rewarding professional experiences.**

## The Five-Stage Team Development Model

---

### 📘 Overview

- Teams **grow and evolve** in a predictable sequence of 5 stages.
    
- Understanding these stages helps project managers **guide teams through conflicts** and improve productivity.
    

---

### 🧩 1. Forming – _Getting Oriented_

- Members meet and learn about the **project and each other**.
    
- They explore **roles**, **goals**, and **acceptable behavior**.
    
- Ask questions like:
    
    - What is my role?
        
    - Who is in charge?
        
    - What are the expectations?
        
- Ends when members **start to identify as a group**.
    

---

### ⚡ 2. Storming – _Conflict and Resistance_

- Internal conflicts arise as individuals **push against group boundaries**.
    
- Struggles over:
    
    - Control
        
    - Decision-making
        
    - Individual vs group identity
        
- Important for members to **resolve tensions** and accept leadership.
    
- Once resolved, team can move forward.
    

---

### 🤝 3. Norming – _Building Team Unity_

- Team becomes **more cohesive and collaborative**.
    
- Members:
    
    - **Build relationships**
        
    - **Establish shared norms** for work and interaction
        
    - **Feel responsible** for group success
        
- Ends when a clear team structure and **shared expectations** are in place.
    

---

### 🚀 4. Performing – _Achieving Goals_

- Characteristics:
    
    - High collaboration
        
    - Clear roles
        
    - Strong commitment to project success
        

---

### 🏁 5. Adjourning – _Wrapping Up_

- Final stage for **temporary project teams**.
    
- Focus is on **completion and disbandment**, not performance.
    
- Mixed emotions:
    
    - **Pride** in achievements
        
    - **Sadness** over ending teamwork and friendships

# Building High-Performance Project Teams

## Recruiting Project Members

### 🔹 Factors Affecting Recruitment

- Depends on **project importance** and **organization’s structure**.
    
- High-priority projects: Project manager has more control.
    
- Low-priority/matrix projects: Must negotiate with **functional managers**.
    

---

### 🔹 Best Practices

- **Ask for volunteers** → leads to stronger commitment.
    
- **Don't steal** top people from other departments without cause → creates enemies.
    
- Know the **needs** of other departments.
    

---

### 🔹 What to Look For (Besides Skills)

1. **Problem-solving ability** – Good under uncertainty.
    
2. **Availability** – Must have time to commit.
    
3. **Technological expertise** – Be careful of people who study a lot but don’t execute.
    
4. **Credibility** – Skilled and respected people boost team reputation.
    
5. **Political connections** – Helpful in matrix structures.
    
6. **Ambition & energy** – Can make up for weaker areas.
    

---

### 🔹 Tips for Project Managers

- Use internal sources to find good, available people.
    
- Discuss clearly with functional managers:
    
    - Project scope
        
    - Tasks & schedule
        
    - Needed skills
        
- Let functional managers suggest names too.
    
- Be flexible and willing to **negotiate**.
    
- **Document all agreements** (e.g., memo of understanding).
    
- Don’t reveal who was reluctantly assigned → affects team morale.

---
## Conducting Project Meetings
### First Project Team Meeting (Kick-off Meeting)

### 🔹 Why It’s Important

- **Sets the tone** for future teamwork.
    
- A well-run meeting = motivated team
    
- A messy meeting = poor team behavior later
    

---

### 🔹 3 Key Goals of the First Meeting

1. **Project Overview**
    
    - Scope, goals, timeline, methods
        
2. **Team Introduction**
    
    - Who’s on the team, roles, getting comfortable
        
3. **Work Style**
    
    - Model how the team will collaborate
        

---

### 🔹 Format Options

- **Off-site retreat (1–2 days)**
    
    - Allows bonding through informal talks
        
- **Short in-office meeting (1 hour)**
    
    - Keep it simple (KISS principle)
        
    - Focus on key info, not everything at once
        

---

### ✅ Establishing Ground Rules

### 🔹 Why Ground Rules Matter

- Defines **how the team will work**
    
- Covers **procedures** and **team behavior**
    
- Builds a solid foundation for collaboration
    

---

### 🔹 Main Areas to Decide On

#### 🟩 Planning

- Who creates the plan?
    
- What software is used?
    
- Who approves deliverables?
    

#### 🟦 Tracking

- How is progress tracked?
    
- How often is data shared?
    
- Who gets progress reports?
    

#### 🟨 Meetings

- Where & when?
    
- Who leads?
    
- How are notes and agendas handled?
    

#### 🟥 Managing Changes

- Who can approve changes?
    
- How are they documented?
    

#### 🟪 Relationships

- Who else (departments, stakeholders) is involved?
    
- How will they be informed?
    

---

### ✅ Creating Team Norms

### 🔹 Norm Examples for High-Performance Teams

- Keep **confidentiality**
    
- Inform others early if you’re falling behind
    
- No bullying or dominating
    
- Respect decisions, even if you disagree
    
- Respect outsiders
    
- Work hard, but still have fun
    

---

### 🔹 Team Charter

- Written agreement of team values and norms
    
- Signed by all members
    
- Only useful if regularly **reviewed and followed**
    

---

### 🔹 Project Manager’s Role

- **Lead by example** (e.g., admit mistakes)
    
- **Correct behavior privately**
    
- Once norms are strong, **team self-regulates**

---
## Establishing a Team Identity
### Why Team Identity Matters

- Many team members only work **part-time** on a project.
    
- They may be on **multiple teams** → feel less connected.
    
- Without a clear identity, the project feels **abstract** → low motivation.
    
- A strong team identity boosts **belonging, motivation, and focus**.
    

---

### ✅ Ways to Build Team Identity

### 🔹 1. Effective Use of Meetings

- Regular meetings = shared space to connect
    
- Helps members see they're part of a **larger team**, not working alone
    
- Reinforces the idea: **“We’re in this together”**
    

---

### 🔹 2. Co-location (Working in the Same Space)

- Best way to create a real team feel
    
- If not possible → create a **project office** (aka _war room/clubhouse_)
    
    - Contains project charts, schedules, and documents
        
    - Shows project progress visually
        
    - Becomes a **symbol of team effort**
        

---

### 🔹 3. Team Name and Logo

- Names like **“A-Team”** or **“Code Ninjas”** create identity
    
- Logos used on shirts, mugs, or documents
    
- Makes team feel **special and united**
    

---

### 🔹 4. Team Bonding Activity

- Do something together early (even simple)
    
- Example: **potluck dinner** where everyone brings food from their country
    
- Builds trust and shared memory
    

---

### 🔹 5. Team Rituals

- Fun or symbolic actions that **celebrate milestones**
    
- Examples:
    
    - Cutting stripes off a tie after each milestone
        
    - Giving toy bugs to members who find real bugs (bigger bug = bigger toy)
        
- Makes project work feel **different and important**
    
- Creates a **mini team culture**
---

## Managing Project Reward Systems

### Why Project Rewards Matter

- **Project work is often rewarding** on its own:
    
    - Inspiring goals
        
    - Learning new skills
        
    - Break from routine
        
    - Satisfaction of completion (“pinball” effect)
        
- But some projects are:
    
    - Boring or underappreciated
        
    - A burden on top of other priorities
        
    - Only reward = getting it over with → leads to **low quality**
        

---

### ✅ Main Responsibility of Project Managers

- Design and manage a **reward system** that:
    
    - Encourages **teamwork**
        
    - Motivates **extra effort**
        
    - Matches the **project’s actual priorities** (e.g., time, cost, quality)
        

---

### ✅ Types of Rewards

### 🔹 Group Rewards (Preferred)

- Emphasize **team success** (since project work is highly collaborative)
    
- Avoid rewarding individuals too often → may damage team unity
    

#### Examples:

- **Cash bonuses** (linked to goals like cost/time/scope)
    
- **Memorable experiences**:
    
    - Family trips (e.g., to Disney World)
        
    - High-value gifts (computers, entertainment systems)
        
- **Celebrations**:
    
    - Pizza parties, BBQs
        
    - Gift cards, event tickets
        
- 🎯 Tip: Rewards should have **lasting significance**, not just temporary benefit
    

---

### 🔹 Individual Rewards (Use Carefully)

Only when someone:

- Shows **extraordinary effort**
    
- Sets a clear example for others
    

#### Examples:

- **Letters of commendation** (to supervisors for performance files)
    
- **Public praise** in team meetings
    
- **Desirable job roles** or assignments
    
- **Flexibility** (e.g., remote work during emergencies)
    

🎯 Use **sparingly and fairly**, to avoid:

- Jealousy
    
- Politics
    
- Loss of team spirit
    

---

### ✅ Using Negative Reinforcement

Sometimes necessary to improve performance.

**Example**:

- Team missing deadlines → Manager starts **daily 6:30 AM meetings**
    
- Result: Team catches up → Meetings end
    
- Message: “Fix the issue or deal with the inconvenience”
---
## Orchestrating the Decision-Making Process
### Everyday Decision-Making in Projects

- Most decisions happen informally during **daily interactions**, not formal meetings.
    
- Example: A mechanical engineer struggles → project manager discusses with designers → consults marketing → updates engineer → gets sponsor approval.
    

### 🔹 This approach is called:

**MBWA – Management by Wandering Around**

- Encourages **trust**, **collaboration**, and **real-time problem-solving**.
    

---

### ✅ When to Use Group Decision-Making

Use group decision-making when:

- The problem is **complex**
    
- **Specialist input** is needed
    
- **Team commitment** is critical
    
- The issue is **controversial**
    
- **Trust is low**
    

Goal: Improve decision quality and increase acceptance.

---

### ✅ Facilitating Group Decisions — 4 Steps

### 1. 🔍 Problem Identification

- Don’t frame it as a choice (e.g., “Should we do X or Y?”)
    
- Define the **core problem** → look for the **gap** between current and desired state
    
- Delay the meeting if emotions are high or people are defensive
    

🧠 Example:

> “We are 4 days behind schedule” → Explore **why**, not just how to fix it

---

### 2. 💡 Generating Alternatives

- Use **brainstorming**: generate lots of ideas without criticism
    
- Encourage **piggybacking** – build on others’ ideas
    
- Creative sessions can be done **away from the normal workplace** for better results
    

📌 Rule: No judgment, only idea generation at this stage

---

### 3. ✅ Reaching a Decision

- Evaluate solutions using clear **criteria**:
    
    - Cost
        
    - Time
        
    - Performance
        
    - Problem resolution
        

#### Manager’s role:

- Summarize progress regularly
    
- Ensure everyone speaks (use timers if needed)
    
- Protect minority views
    
- Test for **true consensus** (don’t assume silence = agreement)
    

💬 Tip: Ask “Is everyone okay with this?” to confirm agreement

---

### 4. 🔁 Follow-Up

- After implementation, **review** the decision:
    
    - Did it solve the problem?
        
    - What went wrong or right?
        
- Add lessons learned to **team memory**
    

📚 Learn from success _and_ failure to improve future decisions.

---
## **Managing Conflict Within a Project**

### Why Conflict Happens in Projects

- Conflicts are **normal** and can be **helpful** or **harmful**
    
- Common reasons:
    
    - Priorities
        
    - Resource allocation
        
    - Work quality
        
    - Technical disagreements
        

### 🔹 Functional Conflict

- Helps the team reach **better solutions**
    
- Encourages **discussion, learning, and innovation**
    

### 🔹 Dysfunctional Conflict

- Hurts team morale and **project performance**

---

### ✅ Conflict During Each Project Phase

| **Phase**      | **Main Sources of Conflict**                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | Priorities, admin procedures, schedules, workforce assignments               |
| **Planning**   | Priorities, schedules, communication methods, technical requirements         |
| **Execution**  | Schedule slippages, technical problems, staffing issues, trade-off decisions |
| **Delivery**   | Final schedules, stress from deadlines, anxiety about future assignments     |
### Encouraging Functional Conflict

- Functional conflict = **improves the project**, even if people are upset
    
- **Shared goals** help resolve technical or personal disagreements
    
- Don’t avoid conflict — silence can hide **important objections**
    

### 💡 How to Encourage Healthy Debate

- Ask tough questions and **challenge assumptions**
    
- Invite **diverse opinions**
    
- Assign a **devil’s advocate**
    
- Ask team to list reasons **not** to follow a decision
    
- Show **good behavior** when others disagree:
    
    - Stay calm, listen actively, summarize concerns
        
    - Ask others if they agree
        
    - Never punish dissenters
        

---

### ✅ Managing Dysfunctional Conflict

### 🔎 Difficulties:

1. It's hard to tell when useful conflict turns harmful
    
2. There's often **no simple fix**
    

---

### 🛠️ 5 Strategies to Handle Dysfunctional Conflict

|**Strategy**|**What It Means**|
|---|---|
|**1. Mediate**|Help both parties find **common ground** using logic and persuasion|

# **Managing Virtual Project Teams**

---

## ✅ What Is a Virtual Project Team?

- A project team that is **geographically spread out**
    
- Members rarely, if ever, meet **face-to-face**
    
- Relies mostly on **electronic communication** (email, chat, video calls)
    

### 🔹 Example:

HP’s project members are located in California, Oregon, Colorado, Singapore, and Korea — working together remotely on the same project.

---

## ✅ Main Challenges

### 1. **Developing Trust**

- Hard to trust teammates you don’t meet in person
    
- No informal interactions (e.g., chatting during breaks)
    
- Can't verify tasks through direct observation
    

**How to Build Trust:**

- Share **personal introductions** and background early
    
- Set **clear roles** and assign **specific tasks** to each member
    
- Encourage reliability, consistency, and responsiveness
    
- Project manager should model **enthusiasm** and **positive energy**
    

---

### 2. **Establishing Effective Communication**

- Email and faxes good for info, but not emotion or real-time conversation
    
- Video conferencing helps show expressions and build relationships
    
- Time zones, cultural differences, and schedules add complexity
    

---

## ✅ Matching Communication Tools to Needs (3M Guidelines)

|**Tool**|**When to Use**|
|---|---|
|**Email**|Share important info one-to-one or one-to-many|
|**Bulletin Boards**|Start discussions and gather diverse opinions|
|**Videoconferencing**|For face-to-face feel — ideal during early project stages and critical decisions|
|**Conference Calls**|For working on shared files and regular status updates|
|**Travel / Face-to-Face**|For building or repairing **trust**; especially useful at project start|

# **Project Team Pitfalls**

---

## ✅ Overview

- High-performance teams can achieve great results
    
- But they also face **dysfunctions** or “pitfalls” if not managed well
    
- These issues usually come from **excesses of positive traits**
    

---

## ✅ Common Pitfalls in Project Teams

---

### 1. **Groupthink**

> Team members lose their ability to critically evaluate ideas due to pressure to conform.

**Symptoms:**

- **Illusion of invulnerability** – team feels overconfident and unstoppable
    
- **Whitewashing critical thinking** – ignores other options or consequences
    
- **Negative stereotypes of outsiders** – dismisses external criticism
    
- **Direct pressure** – silences those who disagree, emphasizes speed and agreement
    

---

### 2. **Bureaucratic Bypass Syndrome**

> Team avoids formal organizational rules and processes.

- Skipping bureaucracy can help move fast
    
- But constant bypassing isolates the team from the organization
    
- Can lead to **conflict** with other departments and **organizational resistance**
    

---

### 3. **Team Spirit Becomes Team Infatuation**

> Members get overly attached to the team and project.

- Project becomes their **only focus**, like being "in love" with the work
    
- May lead to **burnout**, **personal issues**, or **detachment** after the project ends
    

---

### 4. **Going Native**

> Team adopts the customer's views over the company’s.

- Happens in **international projects** or **close client relationships**
    
- Team puts **client needs above organizational goals**
    
- May cause **scope creep** or defiance of company policy
    

---

## ✅ How to Prevent or Reduce These Pitfalls

1. **Awareness is the first step** – understand that these issues can arise
    
2. **Reduce isolation**
    
    - Encourage team members to keep links with their home departments
        
    - Involve **external experts** or **non-team staff** in meetings
        
    - Use **matrix structures** where possible
        
3. **Fight groupthink**
    
    - Manager can act as a **devil’s advocate**
        
    - Use **structured decision-making methods** like **Nominal Group Technique**
        
    - Encourage **constructive conflict**
        
4. **Use team-building sessions**
    
    - Helps surface hidden problems
        
    - Re-centers the team on **shared objectives**
