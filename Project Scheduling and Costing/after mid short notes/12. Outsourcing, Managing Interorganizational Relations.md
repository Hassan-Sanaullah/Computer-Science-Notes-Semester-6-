# **Outsourcing Project Work**

---

## ✅ What Is Outsourcing?

- Traditionally: Transferring business functions (like IT or customer support) to outside firms, often abroad
    
- Now also includes: **Contracting major chunks of project work** to external partners
    

---

## ✅ Examples

- **Tech Industry**: HP & Dell partner with hard drive makers
    
- **Automobile**: Toyota & DaimlerChrysler co-develop car platforms
    
- **Film Industry**: From studio-based to **project-based production** using freelancers & small firms
    
- **Product Development**:
    
    - Example: Reclining chair idea → multiple companies handle design, parts, marketing, and manufacturing
        

---

## ✅ Virtual and Flexible Project Environments

- Many outsourced projects are **virtual**
    
    - Communication via computer, fax, CAD tools, video conferencing
        
    - Team members may never meet in person
        
- Others are **on-site collaborations**
    
    - Work in shared spaces (e.g., construction site)
        
- Members are **not permanent employees**, just **contractual experts** who join and leave as needed
    

---

## ✅ Advantages of Outsourcing Project Work

---

### 1. **Cost Reduction**

- Competitive pricing, especially offshore
    
- Lower overhead (no need to maintain service in-house)
    

---

### 2. **Faster Project Completion**

- More work done for same cost (e.g., 3 engineers in India = 1 in USA)
    
- Specialized equipment access speeds up tasks
    

---

### 3. **High Expertise**

# ✅ The Art of Negotiating – Summary Notes

---

## 🔑 Importance of Negotiation in Project Management

- Negotiation is critical in **all stages of a project**.
    
- It helps avoid converting teamwork ("we") into conflict ("us vs them").
    
- Project managers constantly negotiate with:
    
    - Top management (for support/funding)
        
    - Functional managers (for staff/resources)
        
    - Other project managers (for priorities)
        
    - Their own teams (for tasks, deadlines)
        
    - Vendors/suppliers (for prices/standards)
        

---

## ❌ Misconception: Negotiation is a Contest

- Some people treat negotiation as a **win/lose battle**.
    
- In project work, people are **partners**, not enemies.
    
- **Trust, cooperation, and honesty** are essential.
    
- Conflict can be **productive** if managed well.
    

---

## 🔁 Two Parts of Negotiation

1. **Reaching an agreement**
    
2. **Implementing the agreement**
    

> ⚠️ Implementation determines success, not just the agreement.

- If someone feels **forced or tricked**, they won’t fully commit.
    
- Effective negotiators aim for **satisfaction with both outcome and process**.
    

---

## 🌟 Principled Negotiation (Fisher & Ury Method)

> Focus: **Win/win solutions** and **long-term relationships**

### Four Key Principles:

---

### 1️⃣ Separate the People from the Problem

- Focus on **issues**, not personalities.
    
- Avoid personal attacks or emotional reactions.
    
- Be "hard on the problem, soft on the people".
    
- Build **rapport** before negotiations to reduce conflict.
    
- Control emotions, stay calm, and be empathetic.
    

---

### 2️⃣ Focus on Interests, Not Positions

- Positions: What someone **says** they want  
    Interests: What someone **actually needs**
    

> Example:  
> PM wants delivery by Monday (position)  
> Why? → For a demo (interest)

- **Avoid ego battles** and war of wills.
    
- **Seek to understand first**, then explain your side.
    
- Use **empathetic listening** to uncover true needs.
    

---

### 3️⃣ Invent Options for Mutual Gain

- After knowing interests, **brainstorm solutions**.
    
- Separate idea generation from decision-making.
    
- Encourage **creative thinking** without judging ideas.
    
- Look for **dovetailing**:  
    → One party offers something low-cost to them but high-value to the other.
    

> Example: PM offers **prepayment** to help a vendor’s cash flow in return for **discount + faster delivery**.

---

## 4️⃣ When Possible, Use Objective Criteria

- Use **fair, external standards** to resolve disputes instead of personal opinions.
    
- Examples of objective criteria:
    
    - **Blue Book** for used car pricing
        
    - **Building codes** in construction
        
    - **Legal precedents** in law
        
    - **Financial rules** in accounting
        

### 📌 Real-World Example:

- A **regional airline** and an **accounting team** disagreed on lease classification:
    
    - **Operating lease** → Doesn’t count as debt (airline preferred)
        
    - **Capital lease** → Counted as debt (accountants preferred)
        
- Solution: They used **Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)** rules.
    
- Outcome: The **accountants were right**, but objective rules helped **maintain professionalism** and avoid blame.
    

---

## 😤 Dealing with Unreasonable People

### Problem:

- Some people have a **win/lose mindset** and resist mutual solutions.
    

### Solution: **Negotiation Jujitsu** (Fisher & Ury’s technique)

> Like in martial arts: Don’t push back directly — redirect their energy.

#### 💡 Key Techniques:

1. **Don’t reject or accept their position**  
    → Treat it as one option. Ask: _Why do you believe that?_
    
2. **Don’t defend your own ideas directly**  
    → Invite criticism. Ask: _What would make this idea better?_
    
3. **Use questions instead of statements**  
    → Encourages open discussion and reveals their interests.
    
4. **Use silence as a tool**  
    → If they attack or propose unfair terms, stay silent. Let them rethink and respond.

## 🛡️ BATNA – Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement

> Your **backup plan** if the negotiation fails.

### Why BATNA Matters:

- It gives you **power and confidence** to say "No deal".
    
- It’s the true benchmark to decide whether a deal is worth accepting.
    

### 🔍 Strong vs Weak BATNA:

|Situation|Description|Impact|
|---|---|---|
|**Strong BATNA**|You have **many options** (e.g., multiple suppliers)|You can walk away easily|
|**Weak BATNA**|You're **dependent on one source**|You may have to accept tough terms|

# Managing Customer Expectations and Satisfaction

---

## 🎯 Main Point:

> Project success = **Customer satisfaction**, **not just** time, budget, or specs.

- A happy client may share their experience with 1 person.
    
- An unhappy client tells **8 or more**.
    
- **Project managers must build positive client relationships.**
    

---

## 📊 The Met-Expectations Model of Customer Satisfaction

- **Formula:**
    
    Satisfaction Ratio=Perceived PerformanceExpected Performance\text{Satisfaction Ratio} = \frac{\text{Perceived Performance}}{\text{Expected Performance}}Satisfaction Ratio=Expected PerformancePerceived Performance​

|Ratio|Meaning|Customer Feels|
|---|---|---|
|< 1|Below expectations|Dissatisfied|
|= 1|Met expectations|Satisfied|
|> 1|Exceeded expectations|Very satisfied / Delighted|
