# Project Monitoring Information System (PMIS)

---

## 🧱 1. **What is a Project Monitoring System?**

> A system to **track project performance** and provide relevant data for **decision-making** and **control**.

Involves:

- Deciding **what data** to collect
    
- Determining **how**, **when**, and **who** will collect it
    
- **Analyzing** the data
    
- **Reporting** current progress
    

---

## 📌 2. **What Data Are Collected?**

> Depends on what metrics are used for **controlling** the project.

### Typical Key Data:

- **Actual activity durations**
    
- **Resource usage** and **rates**
    
- **Actual costs**
    

Compared against:

- Planned time
    
- Planned resources
    
- Planned budget
    

### Key Questions Answered:

- What is the **current status** (cost/schedule)?
    
- What is the **forecasted cost** at completion?
    
- When will the project be **completed**?
    
- Are there any **potential issues**?
    
- What/who caused cost/schedule **overruns**?
    
- What value did we **get for the money** spent?
    
- Can we **predict overruns** before completion?
    

👉 Choose **performance metrics** that help answer these questions.

---

## 🧮 3. **Data Collection and Analysis**

### Decide:

- **Who** collects the data?  
    (e.g., project team, contractor, cost engineer, project manager)
    
- **How** is the data collected?  
    (Manual reports, automated tools, surrogate data like labor hours or cash flow)
    
- **When** is it collected?  
    (Hourly, daily, weekly?)
    
- **Where** is it stored?  
    (Is there a **central repository**? Who shares it?)
    

### Tools:

- **Software** helps in:
    
    - Collecting & organizing data
        
    - Analyzing trends
        
    - Detecting problems early
        
    - Updating project plans
        

---

## 📝 4. **Reports and Reporting**

### Who Receives Reports?

- **Different stakeholders need different info:**
    
    - Senior management: High-level info (Time? Budget? Corrective action?)
        
    - Team members: Task-specific updates
        

### Common Progress Report Format:

1. **Progress since last report**
    
2. **Current status**
    
    - Schedule
        
    - Cost
        
    - Scope
        
3. **Cumulative trends**
    
4. **Problems & issues**
    
    - Status of old problems
        
    - New variances
        
5. **Corrective actions** planned
    

---

## 🔄 5. **Interface with Project Control**

- The PMIS should connect smoothly with **project control processes**.
    
- Must be:
    
    - **Relevant** to users
        
    - **Timely**
        
    - **Easy to use**
        
    - **Accurate**

---

# The Project Control Process

> **Control** means comparing actual performance with the plan, spotting problems, and fixing them.

---

## 🔁 4 Steps of the Control Process:

### **Step 1: Setting a Baseline Plan**

- The **baseline plan** is your reference for measuring performance.
    
- Created from:
    
    - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
        
    - **Cost estimates**
        
    - **Duration estimates**
        
    - **Time-sequencing** from scheduling
        
- Includes:
    
    - Planned **work**
        
    - Planned **resources**
        
    - Planned **budget**
        
    - All time-phased (i.e., laid out across the project timeline)
        

---

### **Step 2: Measuring Progress and Performance**

> Focuses on **time** and **budget** (quantitative).

- **Time Performance**:
    
    - Is the **critical path** early, on time, or late?
        
    - Are **near-critical** paths becoming critical (i.e., slack decreasing)?
        
- **Budget Performance**:
    
    - Not just actual vs. planned cost
        
    - Use **Earned Value (EV)**:
        
        - EV = **Budgeted cost** of **work actually done**
            
        - Needed to evaluate performance **against the schedule**
            

---

### **Step 3: Comparing Plan Against Actual**

> Check if the project is **on track** or **off course**.

- Compare:
    
    - Actual progress vs. baseline plan
        
- Use:
    
    - **Status reports** (weekly to monthly)
        
- Purpose:
    
    - **Spot problems early**
        
    - Allow **quick corrections**
        

---

### **Step 4: Taking Action**

> Fix issues or adjust the plan.

- If there's a significant deviation:
    
    - Take **corrective action** to get back on track
        
- If the situation changes:
    
    - **Update** the baseline plan
        
    - Reflect new **scope**, **cost**, or **conditions**

---
# Monitoring Time Performance

> Goal: Catch schedule delays **early** and take corrective action.

## 📋 Tools Used for Monitoring Schedule

### 1. **Tracking Gantt Chart**

- A visual timeline comparing:
    
    - **Planned schedule** (baseline)
        
    - **Actual progress**
        
- Very effective and commonly used for:
    
    - **Communicating with top management**
        
    - Tracking actual vs. planned start/finish dates
        

#### ✅ Features:

- **Solid bars** below planned bars → show **actual start and finish**
    
- **Hatched bars** → show **remaining duration** of in-progress tasks
    
- Revised start and end dates shown for future tasks
    
- Makes it easy to see delays and schedule updates at a glance
    

#### 🔍 Example:

- If Activity C was scheduled for 4 units but finished in 3 → chart shows this clearly
    
- If Activity D is delayed → causes delay in Activity F
    
- Helps track **impacts of changes**
    

---

### 2. **Control Chart**

- Plots **actual progress vs. scheduled progress** over time
    
- Tracks if the **critical path** is on schedule
    
- Reveals **trends** (ahead/behind)
    

#### ✅ How it works:

- Plots differences between:
    
    - Planned position on the **critical path**
        
    - Actual position on the **critical path**
        

#### 🚨 Early Warnings:

- If 4 points show progress in one direction (e.g., delay), it signals a **real problem**
    
- Helps identify the **cause** early so action can be taken
    
- Used for:
    
    - Overall project tracking
        
    - **Milestone monitoring** (important zero-duration events)
        

#### 📌 Milestones:

- Examples: “Product Testing Complete”
    
- Should be:
    
    - **Concrete**
        
    - **Measurable**
        
    - **Clear to all stakeholders**
        
- Often aligned with **critical merge activities**
    

---

## 🕓 Why It Matters

- **Small delays** (1 day) seem minor…
    
- But **accumulate quickly** into major project delays
    
- Regular use of charts helps **catch slippage early**

# Developing a Status Report – Hypothetical Example

## 🎯 Goal

Use **earned value techniques** to measure and report **schedule** and **cost** performance of a project.

---

## 🔧 Assumptions in the Example

1. Each **cost account = one work package = one activity** on the network.
    
2. **Early start times** in the network = baseline schedule.
    
3. **Actual costs** are recorded each period once activity starts.
    

---

## 📦 Baseline Development

### Project: **Digital Camera Prototype**

- 6 Deliverables (e.g., Design Specs, Shell, Software, etc.)
    
- 5 Departments (Design, Shell, Storage, Zoom, Assembly)
    
- **Total Budget** = **$320,000**
    
- **Planned Duration** = **11 time units**
    
- Budget is **time-phased** based on planned work and assigned to the baseline.
    

---

## 📝 Status Report Basics

> A **snapshot** of project performance at a point in time using earned value terms.

### 3 Conditions of Work Packages:

|Condition|Earned Value (EV)|
|---|---|
|Not started|0% of Planned Value (PV)|
|Completed|100% of PV|
|In Progress|% Complete × PV|

---
# Indexes to Monitor Progress

### Why Use Indexes?

- Indexes provide **efficiency ratios** rather than absolute variances (SV, CV).
    
- Easier to interpret trends over time for project deliverables or overall progress.
    
- Used mainly at the **cost account level** and above.
    
- Values interpretation:
    
    - **1.00 (100%)** = Progress as planned
        
    - **>1.00** = Better than planned progress
        
    - **<1.00** = Worse than planned progress, needs attention
        

---

## Performance Indexes

### 1. Cost Performance Index (CPI)

- Formula:
    
    $CPI=EVAC\text{CPI} = \frac{EV}{AC}CPI=ACEV​$
- Measures **cost efficiency** of work done.
    
- Example: $CPI = 160 / 230 = 0.696 (~0.70)$  
    Meaning: For every $1 spent, only $0.70 worth of work is done → **Unfavorable**.
    

### 2. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)

- Formula:
    
    $SPI=EVPV\text{SPI} = \frac{EV}{PV}SPI=PVEV​$
- Measures **schedule efficiency**.
    
- Example: $SPI = 160 / 200 = 0.80$
    Meaning: Only $0.80 worth of work is completed for every $1 worth of work planned → **Behind schedule**.
    
- These indexes help identify project trends visually when graphed over time.
    

---

## Project Percent Complete Indexes

Two different approaches to measuring percent complete:

### 1. Percent Complete based on Budget (PCIB)

- Formula:
    
    $PCIB=EVBAC\text{PCIB} = \frac{EV}{BAC}PCIB=BACEV​$
- Uses **original budget** (Budget at Completion - BAC).
    
- Example:  $PCIB = 160 / 320 = 0.50 (50$%)
    Indicates half the budgeted work has been accomplished (ignores actual costs).
    

### 2. Percent Complete based on Actual and Revised Estimates (PCIC)

- Formula:
    
    $PCIC=ACEAC\text{PCIC} = \frac{AC}{EAC}PCIC=EACAC​$
- Uses **actual costs** and **estimated cost at completion** (EAC).
    
- Example: With EAC re-estimated at 575,  
    $PCIC = 230 / 575 = 0.40 (40$%) 
    Shows progress relative to new, updated cost expectations.
    

---

## Technical Performance Measurement

- As critical as schedule and cost tracking.
    
- Measures whether project technical specifications and quality standards are met.
    
- Can be based on **scope statements, work package docs, or test results**.
    
- Example: A feature deleted in software affects technical performance negatively; exceeding specs can be positive.
    
- Often tied to **quality control processes**.
    
- Difficult to standardize; depends on the project nature.
    
- Project managers need creativity in measuring and controlling technical performance.
    

---

## Project Management Software for Cost/Schedule Systems

- Many software tools exist to track:
    
    - Budget, actual, earned, committed costs or labor hours
        
    - Schedule variance, cost variance, indexes (percent complete, CPI, SPI)
        
    - Cumulative actual costs (AC) and expected costs at completion (EAC)
        
    - Paid and unpaid commitments
        
- Software aims for **clear, user-friendly output**.
    
- Understanding earned value concepts makes it easy to interpret any software reports.
    

---

## Additional Earned Value Rules for Progress Measurement

### 0/100 Rule

- Earns **0%** credit until work package is complete, then **100%** at completion.
    
- Used for **very short-duration** work packages.
    

### 50/50 Rule

- Earns **50%** credit when work starts, and **50%** when complete.
    
- Useful for short-duration and low-cost packages.
    

### Percent Complete with Weighted Monitoring Gates

- Combines subjective percent complete estimates with **hard progress checkpoints** (gates).
    
- Example: An activity with budget $500 split into 3 gates: $150 (30%), $250 (50%), $500 (100%)
    
- Ensures earned value does not exceed predetermined checkpoints.
    
- Helps reduce optimistic estimates and subjective bias.

## Forecasting Final Project Cost

Project managers often need to predict how much money the entire project will cost in the end. This is especially important if the project is not going exactly as planned. There are **two main ways** to forecast this final cost, depending on the size of the project and the available information.

---

### ✅ **Method 1: Expert-Based Forecasting (EAC<sub>re</sub>)**

- In this method, experts working on the project **revise the original estimates**.
    
- They look at:
    
    1. **How much money has already been spent**, and
        
    2. **How much more they think it will take** to finish the remaining work.
        
- Then they **add these two** to get the new expected total cost.
    
- This method is commonly used in **smaller projects**, where experts have a good handle on what's happening.
    

> Think of it like this: “We’ve spent this much so far, and based on what we now know, it will probably take this much more to finish.”

---

### ✅ **Method 2: Performance-Based Forecasting (EAC<sub>f</sub>)**

- This method is more **data-driven**, and used in **larger projects**.
    
- Instead of expert guesses, it relies on how efficiently the project has been running **so far**.
    
- It looks at:
    
    - How much was **originally budgeted**,
        
    - How much work has been **completed**,
        
    - How much has been **spent**, and
        
    - A performance ratio (called **CPI**) that shows **how much value** you’re getting for every dollar spent.
        

> If your past spending has been inefficient (e.g., $1 gives you only $0.70 worth of progress), this method assumes you’ll keep spending inefficiently for the rest of the project.

> So it says: “If we keep going at this rate, how much more will it cost to finish everything?”

---

### ⚖️ Example Outcome:

- A project was originally supposed to cost **$320,000**.
    
- Using performance-based forecasting, the updated estimate now shows it will probably cost **$459,000**.
    
- This big increase happened because the project has been running inefficiently.
    

---

## 📈 TCPI – To-Complete Performance Index

- This is a number that tells you **how efficiently** you must perform going forward to **stay within the original budget**.
    
- It asks: “How much value must each remaining dollar create to still finish on budget?”
    

### Example Meaning:

- If the TCPI is **1.78**, it means:
    
    > “For every dollar left in the budget, you must now accomplish $1.78 worth of work.”
    
- That’s a tough goal — it means you’re already behind and would need a **major boost in productivity** to recover.
    
- In contrast, if TCPI is **less than 1.00**, you're doing well and might **finish under budget**.
    

---

## 🧠 Things to Keep in Mind

- These forecasts assume:
    
    - Your data is reliable.
        
    - Conditions won’t change much.
        
    - Past performance reflects future performance.
        
- This forecasting model is **especially accurate** for big projects that are already at least **15% complete**.
    
- Managers can use this as a **benchmark** and compare it to other predictions based on updated team insights or changing project scope.

---
# **Other Control Issues**

---

## 📌 Scope Creep

- **Scope creep** means small, continuous changes to a project that aren’t planned.
    
- These changes seem harmless but **add up over time** and can derail the project.
    
- A good example is a customer asking for small features in a software project. Eventually, these add up to something much bigger than originally agreed.
    

### 🔺 Problems caused by scope creep:

- Project cost and time increase
    
- Customer dissatisfaction
    
- Team gets frustrated or demotivated
    
- Suppliers face unexpected changes
    
- Cash flow issues in the organization
    
- Team goals become unclear
    

### 🛡️ How to manage scope creep:

- Have a **clear, detailed scope statement**.
    
- Also clearly say what the project **will NOT** include.
    
- Set up a formal process to **authorize and record changes**.
    
- Every change must show:
    
    - Cost and time impact
        
    - Who is responsible
        
    - Any new dependencies
        
- Keep all stakeholders updated with these changes.
    

---

## 📌 Baseline Changes

- Changes in a project are **normal** and sometimes even **good**.
    
- But **poor planning** increases the chance of unwanted changes that cause delays and cost more.
    

### 🛑 Where changes come from:

- **External**: Customer requests, government rules, market demands
    
- **Internal**: New problems discovered, new ideas from the team
    
- **Mixed sources**: Like Denver Airport’s baggage system—added too late, cost $2 billion extra and delayed the project by 16 months
    

### ✅ How to handle baseline changes:

- Only accept changes if:
    
    - The project will fail without them
        
    - They offer big improvement
        
    - The customer agrees and will pay
        
- Always document the impact on cost, time, and scope
    
- Make sure both the **project manager and customer sign off** on the change
    
- Keep the baseline updated after every change
    
- Don't hide mistakes by constantly adjusting the baseline—this is called a **“rubber baseline”**
    

### 🚫 Don't allow:

- Changes to already completed work
    
- Shifting money between accounts after work is done
    

> Use **contingency reserves** to handle unexpected changes.

---

## 📌 The Cost and Trouble of Getting Good Data

- Tracking project progress (like % complete) takes **time and money**
    
- Some teams use **"pseudo percent complete"** methods:
    
    - These are rough estimates instead of real observations
        
    - Work fine for small/medium projects with 1-week tasks
        

### ⚠️ Common issues:

- People resist giving honest % complete updates
    
- Data doesn’t reach the **right people on time**
    
- This leads to **poor decisions and delays**
    

### ✅ Solution:

- Use a strong **communication plan**
    
    - Define how information will flow
        
    - Make sure **stakeholders stay informed**
        
    - Share updates regularly and clearly

# **! Rules for Measuring Work Progress in Projects**

These rules are used in **Earned Value Management (EVM)** to decide how much "credit" (value) a task earns as it progresses.

---

## 📌 0/100 Rule

- You get **0% credit when the task starts**
    
- You get **100% credit only when the task is fully completed**
    
- Good for **short tasks** where partial progress is hard to measure
    
- **Risk**: You might be doing a lot of work but it won’t show until the task is done
    

---

## 📌 100/0 Rule

- You get **100% credit as soon as the task starts**
    
- You get **0% if the task is never finished**
    
- Almost never used because it **overstates progress**
    
- Not realistic, but may be used for very small or low-risk tasks
    

---

## 📌 50/50 Rule

- You get **50% credit when the task starts**
    
- You get the **remaining 50% when the task is completed**
    
- Simple and widely used
    
- Works well when tasks are short and don't stretch over many reporting periods
    

---

## 📌 Percentage Weightage Rule (a.k.a. Weighted Milestone Method)

- Progress is based on **predefined percentages for different parts or phases** of a task
    
- You earn a **portion of the value** as each milestone is completed
    
- Example:
    
    - Task worth $100
        
    - Start = 10%, Mid-check = 30%, Complete = 60%
        
- More **accurate** than the other rules
    
- Best for **longer or complex tasks** that take time and have multiple checkpoints
    

---

## 📝 Summary Table

|Rule|When You Get Credit|Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|0/100|Only after full completion|Short tasks, avoid false progress|
|100/0|Immediately at start|Rarely used, not recommended|
|50/50|Half at start, half at end|Simple and commonly used|
|% Weightage Rule|Based on milestones|Long tasks, more accurate tracking|
