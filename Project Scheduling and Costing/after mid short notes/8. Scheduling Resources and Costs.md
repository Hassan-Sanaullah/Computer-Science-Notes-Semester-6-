# Types of Resource Constraints
In any project, you need **resources** to get work done.  
Resources are things like **people**, **materials**, **equipment**, and **time**.  
If any of these are **missing or limited**, they can **delay or affect** the project.

---

### 🔹 1. People

- These are the workers on a project (like engineers, welders, programmers).
    
- Each person has specific **skills**, and not all skills are **interchangeable**.  
    → Example: You can't replace a programmer with a welder.
    
- Managing people is hard because different tasks need different people.
    

---

### 🔹 2. Materials

- These are the **physical items** you need (like concrete, chemicals, or data).
    
- If materials are **late or missing**, the project **gets delayed**.
    
- Some materials have a **very specific delivery time**.  
    → Example:
    
    - Oil rig in Siberia: delivery window = 1 summer month. If late = 1 year delay.
        
    - Golden Gate Bridge: work allowed only 12 AM–5 AM. $1,000 fine per minute if late.
        
- Planning for materials is critical in **time-sensitive** projects.
    

---

### 🔹 3. Equipment

- Equipment = machines or tools used in the project.  
    (Example: cranes, tractors, lab equipment.)
    
- People **often forget** that equipment might be **busy on other projects**.
    
- Just because your company owns a machine doesn't mean it’s **free when you need it**.
    
- Best solution:  
    → Use a **shared schedule** for all equipment in the company.  
    → Reserve what you need **early** to avoid delays and extra costs.
    

---

### 🔹 4. Time

- Time is a **fixed resource** – you can’t create more of it.
    
- Projects usually have **deadlines** or **time windows** to finish the work.
    
- If one task is late, it can delay the **whole project**.
    
- Good time management means:  
    → Using all other resources (people, materials, equipment) efficiently  
    → Avoiding **penalties**, **extra costs**, or **missed business opportunities**
---

# Classification of a Scheduling Problem

Before scheduling, the project must be classified as either:

### 🔹 1. **Time-Constrained Project**

- **Must be finished by a set date**.
    
- If needed, **extra resources** will be added to stay on schedule.
    
- Time is the **main priority**, but **resources should not be wasted**.
    

---

### 🔹 2. **Resource-Constrained Project**

- Only a **limited amount of resources** are available.
    
- If resources are not enough, **delays are acceptable** (but should be minimized).
    
- Resources are **fixed**, and time is **flexible**.
    

---

### 🔹 Quick Test:

Ask:  
**“If the project is delayed, will we add resources to catch up?”**

- If **yes → Time-Constrained**
    
- If **no → Resource-Constrained**

---
# Splitting Activities

**Splitting** means **pausing a task**, sending the resource to do another task, then **resuming the original task later**.

---

### 🔹 Why Split?

- To make the schedule better
    
- To use resources more efficiently
    
- Works best when **start-up/shutdown costs are low** (e.g., moving equipment)
    

---

### 🔹 When Not to Split

- Avoid splitting **people work** with high mental effort  
    → Example: A designer switching between projects may lose days adjusting mentally
    
- This **hidden cost** can make the project slower
    

---

### 🔹 Risk of Splitting

- Can stretch the task's total time (due to restart delays)
    
- Overusing splitting is a common reason for **project delays**
    

---

### 🔹 Best Practice

- **Avoid splitting** unless:
    
    - Costs are clearly low
        
    - There is **no other option**
        
- Use splitting options in software **carefully and rarely**

---

# Benefits of Scheduling Resources

If resources are limited and time estimates are accurate, **resource limits will affect the actual schedule**, not the ideal one.

---

### 🔹 Why schedule resources before starting?

- Helps you **spot delays early**
    
- Gives time to **adjust priorities** or consider **cost-time trade-offs**
    
- You can **reassess** if the project is really resource-constrained
    
- Allows better decision-making if **delays or risks** are too high
    

---

### 🔹 Other Benefits

- Creates a **time-based budget** for each task
    
- Helps respond quickly to unexpected issues (e.g., equipment failure, staff changes)
    
- Shows how **flexible** resource use is
    
- Makes it easier to **lend or borrow** resources from other projects  
    → Builds **goodwill** and creates favors that can help later

# Assigning Project Work

Project managers must carefully **match tasks with people** based on skills and experience.

---

### 🔹 Task Assignment Tips

- Don’t always give the hardest jobs to the best people  
    → They might feel overused  
    → Others may feel left out and not improve
    
- Balance **task success** with **developing everyone’s skills**
    

---

### 🔹 Team Assignment Tips

- Pair people with **compatible personalities and work styles**  
    → Example: A creative thinker + a detail-focused person
    
- Mix **experienced workers** with **new hires**  
    → Helps train newcomers and pass on work culture
    
- If people will need to work together later, let them **start early**  
    → Builds teamwork before critical phases

# Multiproject Resource Schedules

In real life, resources are shared across **many projects**, not just one.  
Managing resources in this environment is harder because projects have **different goals, timelines, and priorities**.

---

### 🔹 Common Problems

1. **Overall schedule slippage**  
     - Delay in one project **delays others** that depend on the same people or tools.
    
2. **Inefficient resource use**  
     - Resources are sometimes overbooked or **sit idle** depending on project timing.
    
3. **Resource bottlenecks**  
     - Delays happen when many projects need the **same critical resource**.
    

---

### 🔹 How Companies Handle This

- Create a **Project Office** to manage all resources across projects.
    
- Use **First Come–First Served** to assign resources  
     → Helps avoid delays but ignores **project priority**.
    
- Use **project priority systems**  
     → Resources go to **more important projects first**, even if it breaks the order.
    
- **Project scheduling software** can now prioritize resource allocation across multiple projects.
    
- Track and fix bottlenecks to justify:
    
    - Getting more equipment or staff
        
    - Delaying less important projects
        

---

### 🔹 Outsourcing Helps

- **Non-core projects** or **delayed work** can be given to outside firms.
    
- Temporary staff or contractors are used when internal resources are not enough.

# Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline

Once resource assignments are finalized, we create a **time-phased budget baseline**.  
This helps us track **when and where costs occur** over the project timeline.

---

### 🔹 Why Time-Phased Budgets Matter

If we don’t time-phase the budget:

- We can’t tell if **cost overruns** mean we're behind or just ahead of schedule.
    
- Without it, **schedule and cost control become misleading**.
    

📌 **Example**:

- Planned cost in 5 weeks = $2M
    
- Actual cost = $2.4M  
     → Did we overspend or just finish early?
    
- Planned = $2M, Actual = $1.7M  
     → Are we saving money or just **behind**?
    

✅ Without knowing **how much work was done**, the numbers alone can’t answer these questions.

---

### 🔹 How to Create a Time-Phased Budget

Use data from:

- **WBS** (Work Breakdown Structure)
    
- **Resource Schedule**
    
- **OBS** (Organizational Breakdown Structure)
    

**Steps:**

1. Define work package (what)
    
2. Estimate time to complete (how long)
    
3. Time-phase cost (when the money will be spent)
    
4. List needed resources (how much)
    
5. Assign responsible person (who)
    
6. Identify progress checkpoints (how well)
    

🔑 **Step 3 – Time-phasing** is the most important for cost baselines.

---

### 🔹 Time-Phasing Example

- A work package lasts **3 weeks**
    
- Labor costs:  
     Week 1 = $40k, Week 2 = $30k, Week 3 = $50k  
    → These are added to the **project schedule** to form the **baseline**
    

📌 If one activity includes **multiple work packages**, combine their costs and distribute over the full duration.  
E.g.:

- Code (3 weeks): $20k, $15k, $75k
    
- Integration (2 weeks): $70k  
    → Total over 4 weeks: $20k, $15k, $75k, $70k
    

---

### 🔹 Final Output: Project Cost Baseline

This is also called **Planned Value (PV)**  
Used to measure:

- **Schedule variance**
    
- **Cost variance**
    

---

### 🔹 Visual Tools & Outputs

- **Network schedule** → shows when activities occur
    
- **Baseline graph** → shows how cost adds up over time
    
- **Cash flow statement** → shows when money is needed
    
- **Resource usage chart** → shows who works when
