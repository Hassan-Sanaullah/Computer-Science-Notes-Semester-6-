# **Project Closure: Audits and the Audit Process**

Project audits help evaluate how well a project was planned and executed, and what can be learned for future projects. Audits can happen **during the project** or **after it's completed**.

---

## üìå **In-Project vs Post-Project Audits**

### üîπ **In-Project Audit**

- Done **during** the project
    
- Focus is on **ongoing performance**
    
- Helps find issues early and correct them
    
- Can suggest **improvements or termination** if the project isn‚Äôt viable
    

### üîπ **Post-Project Audit**

- Done **after the project ends**
    
- Looks at **what went well** and **what went wrong**
    
- Captures **lessons learned**
    
- Useful for **future project planning**
    
- Includes team, customer, budget, schedule, and scope evaluations

## üìå **The Audit Project Process**

A structured process to conduct project audits, usually has **five steps**:

### 1. **Initiation and Staffing**

- Decide **when** and **why** the audit is needed
    
- Select **audit team** (internal or external members)
    
- Make sure team is **independent**, unbiased, and understands project goals
    
- Define **scope and purpose** of the audit (what will be reviewed)
    

### 2. **Data Collection and Analysis**

- Gather data from:
    
    - Project documents (plans, reports, schedules)
        
    - Team interviews and surveys
        
    - Stakeholder feedback
        
- Analyze data to compare **planned vs actual performance**
    
- Look at cost, time, quality, risk, and team dynamics
    

### 3. **Audit Report**

- Present **findings** (what happened)
    
- Highlight **problems and successes**
    
- Give **recommendations** for future projects
    
- Report must be **clear**, **factual**, and **easy to understand**
    

### 4. **Report Distribution**

- Share audit results with:
    
    - Project manager
        
    - Stakeholders
        
    - Senior management
        
- Be **sensitive** to team morale; avoid blaming individuals
    

### 5. **Follow-Up**

- Check if **recommendations were applied**
    
- Review if **future projects improved**
    
- Important for **learning and growth**

# **Types of Project Closure**

Projects don‚Äôt always end the same way. There are **five common types** of closure based on how and why a project ends. Each type has different challenges.

---

## üîπ 1. **Normal Closure**

- Most common type of closure
    
- The project is **completed as planned**
    
- Deliverables are handed off to:
    
    - Production (in product development)
        
    - Operations (for internal systems like IT tools)
        
- Some scope, cost, or schedule changes may have occurred, but the project ends successfully
    

---

## üîπ 2. **Premature Closure**

- Project is **closed before full completion**
    
- Some parts of the work are **left incomplete**
    
- Often happens under **pressure to release early**
    
    - Example: A marketing team wants to launch a product before testing is done
        
- Carries **high risk**, can lead to failure or poor quality
    
- Needs careful review and approval by **senior management**
    

---

## üîπ 3. **Perpetual Closure**

- Project **never seems to end**
    
- Caused by **constant additions and scope creep**
    
- Often due to **poor scope planning**
    
- Closure is difficult without strong intervention
    
- Suggestion: Finish current phase and start a **new, well-defined project** instead
    

---

## üîπ 4. **Failed Project**

- Project is **officially stopped before completion**
    
- Reason: Unrecoverable problems like technical failure, cost overrun, or external issues
    
- Must **communicate reasons clearly** to avoid blaming the team
    
- Often the failure is due to **factors beyond team control**
    
- Should be treated as a **learning experience**, not a shame
    

---

## üîπ 5. **Changed Priority**

- Organization **changes its strategy**
    
    - Example: Switching from growth to cost-saving focus
        
- Project becomes **less important or irrelevant**
    
- Ongoing projects may be:
    
    - **Modified**
        
    - **Paused**
        
    - **Canceled completely**
        
- Requires alignment with **new business goals**

- Key risks **materialize** and cannot be mitigated
    
- Required technology or resources are **no longer available**
    

---

## üîπ **The Closure Decision**

- The **project sponsor** or **steering committee** usually makes the final decision

    - Risk analysis
        
    - Business case review

    - **Cancelled due to failure or priority change**
        

---

## üîπ **Project Closure Process**

A structured process ensures the project ends properly:

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step:

3. **Release project resources**
    
    - Team members return to departments or other projects
        
4. **Transfer deliverables to operations**
    
    - Product or system handed off to users/maintenance team
        
5. **Conduct post-project review**
    
    - Identify successes, failures, and lessons learned
        
6. **Document everything**
    
    - Final reports, outcomes, and performance data
