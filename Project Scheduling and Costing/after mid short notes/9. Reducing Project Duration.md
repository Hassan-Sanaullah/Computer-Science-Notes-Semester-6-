# Rationale for Reducing Project Duration

Reducing project time (also called **crashing**) is often necessary for business success and flexibility. There are several reasons why this is done.

---

### 🔹 1. **Time to Market Advantage**

- In fast-moving industries (like electronics), **speed = competitive advantage**.
    
- A delay of **6 months** can cost up to **35% market share**.
    
- Companies often crash projects **without formal analysis** to avoid lost revenue.
    

---

### 🔹 2. **Adaptability in Uncertain Times**

- Global challenges (e.g., **recession**, **energy crisis**) require fast responses.
    
- Companies must **quickly adjust** to survive.
    
- Fast project completion supports **business agility**.
    

---

### 🔹 3. **Making Up for Delays**

- Delays from:
    
    - Bad weather
        
    - Design flaws
        
    - Equipment failure
        
- To catch up, **critical activities** are compressed.
    
- Costs of crashing must be compared to **penalties or impacts of being late**.
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Incentive Contracts**

- Contractors are paid **bonuses for early completion**.
    
- Example:
    
    - A bridge was finished **18 months early** → contractor received **$6 million**.
        
- Benefits for both:
    
    - Contractor earns more
        
    - Owner/community gains early use
        

---

### 🔹 5. **Imposed Deadlines**

- Deadlines are set **before planning is complete**.
    
    - e.g., A politician says a building will open in 2 years.
        
- Often unrealistic and:
    
    - **Increase costs**
        
    - **Lower quality**
        
- These deadlines are **not based on actual project data**.
    

---

### 🔹 6. **High Overhead Costs**

- Daily overhead costs can be **very high**.
    
- Crashing the project can reduce total overhead costs.
    
- Example:
    
    - If it costs $1,000/day in overhead,
        
    - But crashing a task costs $500/day → **net savings**
        

---

### 🔹 7. **Releasing Key Resources Early**

- Important when you need:
    
    - A **machine**
        
    - A **team**
        
    - A **specialist** for another project
        
- Compare cost of speeding up the current project vs. **opportunity cost** of waiting.
    

---

### 8. **To Reduce Risks**

- **Longer project durations** increase exposure to risks such as:
    
    - Market changes
        
    - Cost inflation
        
    - Regulatory changes
        
    - Team turnover
        
- Finishing early helps **avoid or minimize these uncertainties**.
    
- Shorter projects are often **easier to control and manage**.

# Options for Accelerating Project Completion

Project managers can accelerate completion using different methods depending on whether **resources are available** or **constrained**.

---

### 🔹 A. **When Resources Are Not Constrained**

#### 1. **Adding Resources**

- Most common method: Add more staff or equipment.
    
- Works best when tasks can be done independently.
    
- Limitations:
    
    - Communication overhead increases (Brooks’s Law).
        
    - Training new people causes delays.
        
    - Best to add early in the project.
        

#### 2. **Outsourcing Project Work**

- Subcontract specialized work to external firms.
    
- Benefits:
    
    - Faster due to expertise or better technology.
        
    - Frees internal resources for critical tasks.
        
- Example: Hiring experts to build a module quickly.
    

#### 3. **Scheduling Overtime**

- Use existing team for extra hours (e.g., 50 hours/week).
    
- Pros:
    
    - Avoids coordination issues of new people.
        
    - Cost-effective if salaried employees are used.
        
- Cons:
    
    - Paid extra for hourly workers.
        
    - Risks: burnout, fatigue, reduced long-term productivity.
        

#### 4. **Establishing a Core Project Team**

- Assign a full-time, dedicated team.
    
- Benefits:
    
    - No multitasking → full focus.
        
    - Higher cohesion and productivity.
        
    - Faster delivery due to shared goals.
        

#### 5. **Do It Twice – Fast and Correctly**

- Build a temporary or minimal version first.
    
- Then build the complete version later.
    
- Useful when deadlines are critical.
    
- Extra cost may be worth the time saved.
    

---

### 🔹 B. **When Resources Are Constrained**

#### 6. **Fast-Tracking**

- Perform critical tasks **in parallel**, not in sequence.
    
- Method:
    
    - Change finish-to-start to start-to-start relationships.
        
- Requires:
    
    - Tight coordination.
        
    - Creativity in planning.
        
- Can lead to significant time savings.
    

#### 7. **Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)**

- Focuses on resource availability and buffers.
    
- Requires organizational change and training.
    
- Not ideal for mid-project adoption.
    
- Shows good results if implemented fully.
    

#### 8. **Reducing Project Scope**

- Deliver fewer features or lower specs.
    
- Example: Software with fewer features or car with lower MPG.
    
- Risks:
    
    - Lower value or customer dissatisfaction.
        
- Best practice:
    
    - Reassess what’s essential vs. desirable.
        
    - Adjust Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and focus on critical path.
        

#### 9. **Compromising Quality**

- Rarely used.
    
- May shorten time by cutting testing or refinement.
    
- High risk to product success and customer satisfaction.
    

---

### 🔸 Most Common Methods in Practice:

- **Scheduling Overtime**
    
- **Outsourcing**
    
- **Adding Resources**
    

These methods maintain the original project plan, while others (like fast-tracking or scope reduction) involve changing the plan or its expectations.

# Explanation of Project Costs

Projects have two major types of costs that behave differently with time. Understanding how **direct** and **indirect** costs change with project duration helps in making smart decisions about whether or not to reduce the project timeline.

---

### 🔹 1. **Total Project Cost**

- **Total Cost = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs**
    
- A graph (like Figure 9.1) shows how total cost changes with project duration.
    
- Goal: Find the **optimum duration** where the total cost is minimized.
    

---

### 🔹 2. **Indirect Costs**

These are **time-based costs** that continue for the full life of the project.

#### Examples:

- Administration
    
- Supervision
    
- Consultants
    
- Office rent
    
- Interest on loans
    

#### Key Points:

- Not tied to specific activities → called “indirect.”
    
- **Decrease when project duration is shortened.**
    
- For example, if indirect cost is $2,000/day, reducing project time by 5 days saves $10,000.
    

---

### 🔹 3. **Direct Costs**

These are **activity-based costs** directly assigned to specific tasks.

#### Examples:

- Labor
    
- Materials
    
- Equipment
    
- Subcontractor charges
    

#### Key Points:

- Tied to specific work packages → called “direct.”
    
- **Increase when activity time is shortened.**
    
    - Faster work may require:
        
        - Overtime
            
        - Extra workers
            
        - Special machinery
            
- Normal duration = lowest direct cost (efficient working).
    
- Imposed or reduced time = higher direct costs.
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Cost-Time Trade-Off**

- When project duration is reduced:
    
    - **Indirect cost ↓**
        
    - **Direct cost ↑**
        
- The goal is to **balance both** to find the **lowest total cost point**.
    
- Optimum duration is found where:
    
    - **Savings in indirect cost > Increase in direct cost**
        
- In real life, there are usually some critical tasks that can be shortened **at a lower cost** than the daily indirect cost — this creates opportunity for savings.

---

# Practical Considerations: Using the Cost–Duration Graph

The cost–duration graph helps managers decide whether reducing project time is worth it. But in practice, several **important factors** and **challenges** must be considered beyond just costs.

---

### 🔹 1. **Why Use the Cost–Duration Graph?**

- Compares any change or deadline with **optimum cost-time point**.
    
- Keeps **indirect costs** visible in decisions (often forgotten in the field).
    
- Can be created at 3 stages:
    
    1. **Before the project** (best) – uses _normal_ durations.
        
    2. **During planning** with deadline – less ideal, forces normal time to fit imposed date.
        
    3. **After start** (worst) – limited options left to adjust.
        

---

### 🔹 2. **Crash Times: Real-World Challenges**

- **Crash time** = shortest _realistic_ time to finish an activity.
    
- Hard to define, interpret, or estimate accurately.
    
- Estimators often feel uncertain giving crash values.
    
- **Normal time/cost estimates are more reliable** than crash time estimates.
    

---

### 🔹 3. **Linearity Assumption**

- The cost-time graph **assumes a straight-line (linear)** relationship.
    
- In reality, it’s often **curved**, but for most projects:
    
    - The **linear assumption is “good enough.”**
        
    - Allows quick and practical decisions.
        
- Some activities can only be **fully crashed** or **not at all** (no in-between).
    

---

### 🔹 4. **Revisiting Which Activities to Crash**

Beyond just choosing the cheapest ones, consider:

#### ✅ a. **Risk**

- Crashing risky tasks (e.g., software design) may cause future issues (bugs, rework).
    

#### ✅ b. **Timing**

- Crashing **early activities** may help if **later delays are expected.**
    

#### ✅ c. **Resource Availability**

- Cheapest activity might not be crashable if required **resources are unavailable.**
    

#### ✅ d. **Team Morale**

- Overburdening the same group → **fatigue and resentment.**
    
- Unequal overtime pay → **tension between teams.**
    
- Good managers assess **team reaction** before crashing.
    

---

### 🔹 5. **Time Reduction and Project Sensitivity**

#### ✅ a. **Should you always reduce to the optimum time?**

- **Not always. Depends on project risk.**
    

#### ✅ b. **What is network sensitivity?**

- **Sensitive Network** = many critical or near-critical paths
    
    - **High risk**: Slack reduction creates **more critical paths.**
        
    - Can **increase total cost** if delays occur in new critical paths.
        
- **Insensitive Network** = one dominant critical path
    
    - **Low risk**: Can reduce time safely.
        
    - Has **high potential for large cost savings** (especially if indirect costs are high).
        

#### 📌 Example:

- A light rail project had a dominant critical path and high indirect costs.
    
- Crashing a few activities saved **millions**, which were reinvested to expand the project.

# What If **Cost**, Not **Time**, Is the Issue?

While most projects focus on saving **time**, many also need to **save money**—especially in:

- **Fixed-bid projects** (profit depends on cost savings)
    
- **Tight budgets** or **cost-cut contracts**
    
- When **clients absorb the cost**, and overruns damage trust or future business
    

Sometimes reducing time **increases** cost (e.g. overtime), but in other cases, **extending** the timeline can **save** cost (e.g. using fewer workers or cheaper materials).

---

## 🔹 Common Ways to Cut Project Costs

### 1. 🧩 **Reduce Project Scope**

- Deliver less than originally planned = cost savings.
    
- No need to focus on critical path like time-based reductions.
    
- Example: Film projects might replace expensive location shoots with **stock footage**.
    

---

### 2. 🏗️ **Have the Owner (Client) Take on Some Work**

- Let the client handle **some tasks themselves**:
    
    - Painting
        
    - Equipment testing
        
    - Internal training
        
- Best to negotiate this **before** the project starts.
    
- Saves money **without reducing scope**.
    
- Works only if the client has **skills and time**.
    

---

### 3. 🌍 **Outsource Activities or Entire Project**

- External vendors may be **cheaper and more efficient**:
    
    - Lower salaries
        
    - Equipment advantages
        
    - Bulk material discounts
        
- Example: US companies outsource software development to India to save cost.
    
- Downsides:
    
    - **Less control** over project
        
    - Must define deliverables **very clearly**
        

---

### 4. 💡 **Brainstorm Cost-Saving Ideas**

- Ask the team: “Is there a **cheaper** or **better** way?”
    
- In one case, a team suggested **$75,000+ in savings** without hurting project quality.
    
- Teams often have **practical ideas** not considered by management.
    

---

## 🔸 Final Thought

Cost-saving doesn’t always mean cutting corners. By:

- Adjusting scope,
    
- Sharing work with clients,
    
- Outsourcing wisely,
    
- And involving the team,
    

**You can lower project costs** while maintaining **quality and value**.
