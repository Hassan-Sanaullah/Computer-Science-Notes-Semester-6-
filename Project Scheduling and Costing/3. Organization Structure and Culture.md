# Project Management Structures

A project management system provides a framework for launching and implementing projects within an organization, balancing the needs of both the parent organization and the project.

## Organizing Projects within the Functional Organization

### Approach

1. **Functional Hierarchy**:  
   Projects can be managed within the existing functional structure, where segments of the project are delegated to respective functional units.
   
2. **Coordination**:  
   Coordination is maintained through **normal management channels**. For example, in a tool manufacturing company:
   - **Industrial design** department modifies tool specifications.
   - **Production** department develops production processes.
   - **Marketing** department handles demand, pricing, and distribution.

3. **Functional Dominance**:  
   When a specific functional area plays a dominant role in the project, a high-ranking manager from that area is appointed to coordinate the project.  
   Examples:
   - **Facilities department** manages the transfer of equipment and personnel to a new office.
   - **Information systems department** manages the upgrade of the management information system.

### Advantages of Using the Existing Functional Organization

1. **No Change**:  
   Projects are managed within the existing functional structure without altering the organization's design or operations.
   
2. **Flexibility**:  
   The flexibility to temporarily assign specialists from different functional units to work on the project, with minimal disruption.
   
3. **In-Depth Expertise**:  
   When the project scope is narrow, specialized knowledge can be applied to the project by assigning relevant functional units.
   
4. **Easy Post-Project Transition**:  
   Specialists maintain their career paths within their functional divisions, ensuring stability post-project.

### Disadvantages of Using the Functional Organization for Projects

1. **Lack of Focus**:  
   Functional units may prioritize their routine work, leading to delayed project activities. Conflicting priorities between functional departments can also cause delays.
   
2. **Poor Integration**:  
   Lack of coordination across functional units may result in poor integration, with each department focusing only on its segment rather than the whole project.
   
3. **Slow Completion**:  
   The process can be slower due to **slow response times** and the lack of **direct communication** across departments.
   
4. **Lack of Ownership**:  
   Since employees work only on a segment of the project, they may lack ownership and commitment to the overall project, viewing it as an additional burden not tied to their professional development.

## Example: Dedicated Project Team in Functional Organization

- A **project manager** coordinates the project, with a team from different functional areas working under their leadership (Figure 3.2).
# Organizing Projects as Dedicated Teams

A **dedicated project team** operates as a separate unit from the parent organization. The project manager recruits a core group of specialists who work full-time on the project, often physically separated from the parent company. The team is given clear objectives and is accountable for completing the project.

## Interface with Parent Organization

- The relationship between the project team and the parent organization can vary:
  - **Financial control**: The parent organization may maintain strict financial oversight.
  - **Autonomy**: The project manager may be granted maximum freedom to manage the project.
  
Lockheed Martin uses this approach for next-generation jet airplane development, referred to as **Skunk Works**.

### Projectized Organization

In firms where projects are the core business, such as construction or consulting firms, the entire organization supports project teams. **Projectized Organizations** are designed to focus entirely on projects, with functional departments (e.g., marketing, HR) assisting project teams. These organizations consist of multiple **quasi-independent project teams**.

## Strengths of Dedicated Project Teams

1. **Simplicity**:  
   The parent organization remains intact, and resources are temporarily assigned to the project.
   
2. **Speed**:  
   Projects are completed more quickly because participants focus entirely on the project, and decision-making occurs within the team.
   
3. **Cohesion**:  
   The team shares common goals and responsibilities, leading to high motivation and collaboration.
   
4. **Cross-Functional Integration**:  
   Specialists from different areas work closely together, optimizing the entire project, not just their individual areas of expertise.

## Weaknesses of Dedicated Project Teams

1. **Expense**:  
   Creating new management positions (project manager) and assigning full-time resources can be costly. This may lead to **duplication of efforts** across projects and a loss of **economies of scale**.
   
2. **Internal Strife**:  
   The project team can become an isolated entity, developing a **we–they** mentality. This creates difficulties in integrating project outcomes into mainstream operations and in transitioning team members back to their functional departments post-project.

3. **Limited Technological Expertise**:  
   The self-contained team may lack access to broader technological expertise available within the parent organization. While consultation is possible, the **we–they** syndrome and lack of formal organizational support discourage this interaction.

4. **Difficult Post-Project Transition**:  
   Returning full-time project personnel to their original functional departments can be challenging after prolonged absence. They may need time to catch up with recent developments in their functional areas.

# Organizing Projects within a Matrix Arrangement

Matrix management is a hybrid organizational form where a **horizontal project management structure** is "overlaid" on the **functional hierarchy**. In a matrix system, there are usually two chains of command: one along functional lines and the other along project lines. Project participants report to both functional and project managers simultaneously.

## General Application of Matrix Management

- Some organizations set up temporary matrix systems for specific projects, while for others, it is a permanent feature.
- Example: Three projects (A, B, and C) with multiple teams and responsibilities across functional departments (manufacturing, engineering, marketing).

### Design of Matrix Structure

- **Project A**: Design and expansion of a production line, with 3.5 people from manufacturing and 6 from engineering.
- **Project B**: New product development requiring heavy input from engineering, manufacturing, and marketing.
- **Project C**: Forecasting customer needs, with part-time administrative support.
- The matrix structure utilizes resources optimally by allowing individuals to work on multiple projects and perform functional duties.

## Types of Matrix Systems

1. **Weak Matrix**:
   - Resembles a **functional structure**.
   - A formally designated project manager coordinates activities.
   - Functional managers control most decisions and assign personnel and tasks.
   
2. **Balanced Matrix**:
   - Project manager defines what needs to be accomplished, while functional managers determine how it will be done.
   - Project manager integrates contributions, sets schedules, and monitors progress.
   - Both functional and project managers work closely together, making joint decisions.
   
3. **Strong Matrix**:
   - The project manager controls most aspects of the project, including scope trade-offs and assignment of functional personnel.
   - Functional managers are consulted but have less control over their people and tasks.
   - A more project-team-like environment within the matrix.

## Advantages of Matrix Structure

1. **Efficient**:  
   Resources can be shared across multiple projects and functional divisions, reducing duplication.

2. **Strong Project Focus**:  
   A designated project manager ensures integration and coordination of contributions, fostering a holistic problem-solving approach.

3. **Easier Post-Project Transition**:  
   Specialists maintain ties with their functional group, easing their transition back after the project.

4. **Flexible**:  
   Matrix systems allow flexible utilization of resources and expertise, depending on project and functional needs.

## Weaknesses of Matrix Structure

1. **Dysfunctional Conflict**:  
   Tension between functional and project managers can escalate into personal conflicts, disrupting collaboration.

2. **Infighting**:  
   Sharing resources across projects can lead to competition and conflicts between project managers.

3. **Stressful**:  
   Project participants report to multiple bosses, which can be overwhelming and lead to conflicting priorities.

4. **Slow Decision-Making**:  
   Decision-making can become bogged down in a matrix structure, especially in a balanced matrix, as agreements need to be forged across multiple functional groups.

## Pros and Cons of Different Matrix Forms

- **Strong Matrix**:  
   - Enhances project integration and control but may diminish technical quality due to reduced control by functional areas.
   - May lead to **projectitis**, where a strong team identity develops.
   
- **Weak Matrix**:  
   - Improves technical quality and manages conflict better, but often results in poor project integration due to the dominance of functional managers.
   
- **Balanced Matrix**:  
   - Achieves a balance between technical and project requirements but is difficult to manage, often leading to problems inherent in matrix management.

# What Is the Right Project Management Structure?

Empirical evidence suggests that project success is linked to the amount of **autonomy and authority** project managers have over their projects. However, the best system balances the needs of the project with those of the parent organization. The structure used should depend on a variety of factors at both the **organization** and **project** level.

## Organization Considerations

1. **Importance of Project Management**:
   - If **over 75% of work** involves projects, consider a **fully projectized organization**.
   - For organizations with both standard products and projects, a **matrix arrangement** is appropriate.
   - For organizations with very few projects, a **less formal arrangement** is sufficient, possibly outsourcing project work.

2. **Resource Availability**:
   - Matrix management evolved to share resources across multiple projects and functional domains.
   - If an organization cannot afford to dedicate critical resources to individual projects, a **matrix system** would be suitable.
   - An alternative is creating **dedicated teams** and outsourcing when resources are unavailable internally.

3. **Assessing Current Practices**:
   - Transitioning to a stronger project matrix takes time and requires leadership.
   - Many companies transition from a **weak functional matrix** to a stronger **project matrix**.
   - **Project Management Offices (PMOs)** are often created to support project management efforts.

## Project Considerations

At the project level, determining how much **autonomy** the project needs is crucial for its success. The following **seven factors** should influence the choice of project management structure:

1. **Size of the project**
2. **Strategic importance**
3. **Novelty and need for innovation**
4. **Need for integration** (number of departments involved)
5. **Environmental complexity** (number of external interfaces)
6. **Budget and time constraints**
7. **Stability of resource requirements**

The higher the levels of these factors, the more **autonomy and authority** the project manager and team need, which suggests using either a **dedicated project team** or a **project matrix structure**.

### When to Use Specific Structures

- **Dedicated Project Teams** or **Project Matrix** structures are suitable for:
  - Large, **strategically critical projects**.
  - **New projects** requiring innovation.
  - **Multidisciplinary projects** that involve input from many departments.
  - Projects requiring constant customer contact.
  - Urgent projects that need consistent work from start to finish.

### Example: Chaparral Steel

Chaparral Steel classifies projects into **three categories**:
- **Advanced development**: High-risk, breakthrough projects.
- **Platform projects**: Medium-risk system upgrades.
- **Incremental projects**: Low-risk, short-term adjustments.

Chaparral Steel uses different matrix structures for different types of projects:
- **Weak matrix**: Used for **incremental projects**.
- **Strong matrix**: Used for **platform projects**.
- **Dedicated teams**: Used for **advanced development projects**.

This **mix and match** approach is becoming common among firms managing diverse projects.

# Organizational Culture

The connection between **project management structure** and **organizational culture** is strong, as observed in a conversation with two project managers at a medium-sized IT firm. One manager noted that a complicated structure with 52 different teams worked because of their company’s culture. This highlights that organizational culture can enable a structure to succeed.

## What is Organizational Culture?

**Organizational culture** refers to a system of shared norms, beliefs, values, and assumptions that bind people together, creating shared meanings. It is manifested through **customs and habits** that reflect the organization’s values.

- Example: **Egalitarianism** may be reflected by informal dress in a high-tech firm; mandated uniforms may indicate hierarchy in a department store.
  
Culture reflects the **personality** of an organization and can help predict **attitudes** and **behaviors** of its members. It is also a key differentiator between organizations, even within the same industry.

### 10 Primary Characteristics of Organizational Culture

These characteristics capture the essence of an organization's culture:

1. **Member identity**: The degree to which employees identify with the organization.
2. **Team emphasis**: The extent to which work activities are organized around groups.
3. **Management focus**: How management decisions consider the effects on people within the organization.
4. **Unit integration**: The extent to which units operate in a coordinated manner.
5. **Control**: The degree of rules, policies, and direct supervision in the organization.
6. **Risk tolerance**: How employees are encouraged to be innovative and risk-seeking.
7. **Reward criteria**: How rewards like promotions and salary increases are allocated.
8. **Conflict tolerance**: The extent to which employees are encouraged to address conflicts openly.
9. **Means versus end orientation**: Whether management focuses on outcomes or processes.
10. **Open-systems focus**: How the organization responds to external changes.

### Culture Functions

- **Identity**: Provides a sense of identity, making employees feel part of the organization and generating commitment.
- **Legitimizes the management system**: Clarifies authority relationships and why authority should be respected.
- **Clarifies behavior standards**: Defines what is permissible and appropriate behavior, contributing to social order.

### Organizational Culture: Strong vs. Weak

- **Strong culture**: Core values and customs are widely shared.
- **Weak culture**: Values and customs are not widely shared.
- **Subcultures**: Specific norms develop within departments or professional fields.
- **Countercultures**: Cultures that contradict the official culture, often emerging within organizations.

### Identifying Cultural Characteristics

Assessing culture involves analyzing both **current** and **historical** contexts. Key areas to examine include:

1. **Physical Characteristics**: Architecture, office layout, attire. Does the design reflect hierarchy or equality?
2. **Public Documents**: Annual reports, mission statements, etc. These can reveal if the company prioritizes people or financial performance.
3. **Behavior**: Interaction patterns, meeting rituals, decision-making style, and the values expressed.
4. **Folklore**: Stories, heroes, villains. Recurring stories help define what is important to the organization.

### Example: Power Corp. Cultural Diagnosis

- **Physical Characteristics**: Modern buildings for senior management; formal attire indicates hierarchy.
- **Public Documents**: Vision statement emphasizes integrity and performance.
- **Behavior**: Hierarchical decision-making; meetings start and end on time; careful language when speaking to superiors.
- **Folklore**: Stories of employees being punished or rewarded for their actions, such as a project manager fired for bypassing a superior.

### Promotional and Reward Systems

The **basis for promotions** and rewards within an organization provides critical insight into what behaviors are valued. Examples like a project manager being ostracized for questioning a marketing report show how the organizational culture influences career success.

By analyzing these elements, an observer can **assess the strength** of a culture and identify how subcultures and countercultures influence the organization's norms and behaviors.

## Implications of Organizational Culture for Organizing Projects

Project managers must operate in diverse organizational cultures. They interact with:
1. **Parent organization culture** and subcultures of various departments (e.g., marketing, accounting).
2. **Project client/customer organizations.**
3. **Other organizations** connected to the project (e.g., suppliers, vendors, government agencies, community groups).

Each organization may have different cultures. Project managers need to understand these cultures to develop strategies and plans that are accepted and understood. This chapter focuses on the relationship between organizational culture and project management structure, which is discussed further in Chapters 10–12 (leadership, team building, and outsourcing).

### Organizational Culture and Project Management Structure
There are strong relationships among project management structure, organizational culture, and project success. Certain cultural aspects support successful project management while others may interfere with effective management. Figure 3.7 identifies which cultural characteristics create a conducive environment for managing complex projects.

Note that **ideal culture** is often not at either extreme but balances different aspects. For example:
- A fertile project culture would balance focus on both **task** and **people** needs.
- An optimal culture would balance concern with **output (ends)** and **processes (means)**.

In some cases, the ideal culture is at one end of the dimension:
- Emphasize **teamwork** and **organization identity** rather than individual professional domains.
- Support **risk-taking** and **tolerance for constructive conflict**.

### Cultural Dimensions of an Organization Supportive of Project Management
- **Member identity**: Identifying with the organization as a whole.
- **Team emphasis**: Organizing work activities around groups.
- **People focus**: Considering the effect of outcomes on people.
- **Unit integration**: Encouraging coordinated operations across units.
- **Control**: Use of rules, policies, and direct supervision.
- **Risk tolerance**: Encouraging innovation and risk-seeking.
- **Reward criteria**: Allocating rewards based on performance.
- **Conflict tolerance**: Encouraging open airing of conflicts.
- **Means-ends orientation**: Focusing on outcomes rather than processes.
- **Open-system focus**: Monitoring and responding to external changes.

### Case Study: 3M
3M fits the ideal culture profile for supporting project management. It has an entrepreneurial culture within a large corporate framework. Key elements include:
- **Freedom and autonomy**: Encouraging experimentation and initiative.
- **15% rule**: Allowing technical staff to spend 15% of their time on personal projects.
- This culture has contributed to the success and innovation of 3M, resulting in over 60,000 products and 35 business units.

### Metaphor: Organizational Culture and Project Management
The relationship between organizational culture and project management can be compared to a riverboat trip:
- **Fertile culture**: Like paddling downstream, where teamwork and cross-functional cooperation are norms, and healthy conflict is managed effectively.
- **Toxic culture**: Like paddling upstream, requiring more effort and resources to complete projects. In toxic cultures, teamwork is discouraged, conflict is not tolerated, and relationships rather than performance dictate success.

### Implications of the Metaphor
- Projects in a **negative cultural current** require more authority and resources.
- Projects in a **positive cultural environment** require less formal authority and fewer resources.
