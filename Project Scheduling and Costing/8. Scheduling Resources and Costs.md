# Types of Resource Constraints (Project Scheduling and Cost)

## Introduction
- In project management, **resources** refer to the elements required to complete project tasks:  
  → **People**, **Equipment**, and **Materials**.  
- The **availability or lack thereof** of these resources **significantly affects how a project is scheduled and executed**.
- Understanding the **constraints** imposed by each resource type is essential to avoid **delays**, **cost overruns**, and **productivity loss**.

---

## 1. People (Human Resources)
- **Most essential and complex** project resource.
- Human resources are categorized by the **skills or expertise** they contribute to the project.  
  **Examples**:  
  - Programmer  
  - Mechanical Engineer  
  - Welder  
  - Inspector  
  - Marketing Director  
  - Supervisor  

- **Key Challenges**:
  - **Skill specialization** makes substitution difficult.  
  - Interchangeable skills (e.g., two engineers) can result in **reduced efficiency** and **lower productivity**.
  - **Managing multiple skillsets** adds complexity to **project scheduling**, as not all tasks can be assigned interchangeably.

---

## 2. Materials
- Materials include **physical items or data** necessary for completing project tasks.  
  **Examples**:  
  - Chemicals (scientific projects)  
  - Concrete (construction projects)  
  - Survey data (marketing projects)

- **Constraints & Risks**:
  - Material **shortages** and **delays in delivery** can **significantly impact timelines**.
  - In projects where material availability is a **known risk**, materials should be **explicitly included** in the **project schedule and network plan**.

###  Real-World Examples:
1. **Siberian Oil Rig Delivery**:
   - Tower delivery must occur in a **narrow summer window**.
   - If missed, the **entire project is delayed by a full year**, increasing costs dramatically.
2. **Golden Gate Bridge Resurfacing**:
   - Work was limited to **Midnight–5:00 A.M.** to minimize traffic disruption.
   - Penalty: **$1,000 per minute** for work beyond 5:00 A.M.
   - Scheduling of **replacement structures** was **crucial** to stay within the 5-hour limit.
3. **Time-to-Market in Product Development**:
   - Delays in acquiring materials can lead to **missed market opportunities**.
   - Projects with **tight go-to-market deadlines** must **carefully manage material logistics**.

---

## 3.  Equipment
- Equipment resources are specified by **type**, **size**, and **quantity**.
  **Examples**: Cranes, earthmoving tractors, specialized lab equipment.

- **Challenges**:
  - Often **overlooked** during planning due to assumptions of availability.
  - It’s common to **underestimate demand** or **ignore conflicts** with other projects.

###  Example Scenario:
- A project requires an **earthmoving tractor** six months from now.
- The company owns **four tractors**, so planners assume availability.
- **Reality**: All tractors may be assigned to other projects when needed, causing **unexpected delays**.

###  Best Practices:
- In **multi-project environments**, maintain a **centralized/common resource pool**:
  - Allows checking **resource allocation** across all projects.
  - Helps **reserve equipment** ahead of time.
  - Prevents **schedule conflicts**, **resource bottlenecks**, and the need for **costly project crashing** (accelerating work using extra resources).

- Identifying equipment needs and constraints **early in planning** reduces risk and improves **schedule reliability**.

# Classification of Scheduling Problems & Resource Allocation Methods

---

## 1. **Classification of a Scheduling Problem**

In project management, projects are classified into two main categories based on constraints: 
- **Time-Constrained Projects**
- **Resource-Constrained Projects**

To determine which category a project falls into, a simple question is asked:
- **Question**: "If the critical path (the longest sequence of tasks that determine project duration) is delayed, will additional resources be added to get the project back on track?"
  - **Yes** → The project is **Time-Constrained**.
  - **No** → The project is **Resource-Constrained**.

### a. **Time-Constrained Projects**
- **Time is fixed**: The project must be completed by a specific date.
- **Resources can be added**: If necessary, more resources (people, equipment, etc.) can be allocated to meet the deadline.
- **Goal**: Complete the project on time while minimizing additional resource usage.

### b. **Resource-Constrained Projects**
- **Resources are fixed**: The number of available resources (e.g., workers, equipment) cannot be exceeded.
- **Delays are acceptable**: If there are not enough resources to meet the project's needs, delays are acceptable, but efforts should be made to minimize them.
- **Goal**: Complete the project without exceeding the resource limits, even if that means extending the timeline.

### c. **Summary of Differences**:

| **Type of Constraint**   | **Time Flexible?** | **Resource Flexible?** | **Project Delay Acceptable?** |
|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Time-Constrained**      | No                 | Yes                    | No                          |
| **Resource-Constrained**  | Yes                | No                     | Yes                         |

---

## 2. **Resource Allocation Methods**

When managing resources for a project, the goal is to use them as efficiently as possible. Below are the methods and assumptions typically used for resource allocation:

### a. **Assumptions** (for simplicity):
1. **No splitting of activities**: Once an activity starts, it continues until completion. Activities cannot be paused and resumed.
2. **Fixed resource usage**: The amount of resources (e.g., labor, equipment) used for an activity cannot change once the activity has started.

These assumptions simplify the learning process but may not be entirely realistic in actual projects.

---

## 3. **Time-Constrained Projects: Smoothing Resource Demand**

In time-constrained projects, the focus is on **maximizing the utilization** of resources to meet deadlines.

### a. **Problem**:
- When resources are required in varying amounts throughout the project, it can lead to periods of high demand (peaks) and low demand (valleys).
- This fluctuation is hard to manage and can waste resources.

### b. **Solution: Resource Leveling**
- **Resource leveling** aims to **smooth out the peaks and valleys** in resource usage by delaying non-critical activities (those with slack) to better distribute resource demand over time.
- **Slack**: The extra time available for a task without affecting the overall project schedule.

### c. **Example: Botanical Garden Project**
- **Resource**: Backhoes (machinery)
- **Original demand**: 4 backhoes needed from day 4 to day 10.
- By delaying certain tasks with slack (like fencing and walls), the peak demand can be reduced to just 3 backhoes.
- **Goals Achieved**:
  - Reduced peak resource demand
  - Lowered total resource usage
  - Smoothed out the demand fluctuations, making the project easier to manage

### d. **Challenges**:
- Reducing slack to level resources can make some tasks more critical, increasing the risk of delays.
- Over-leveled schedules (where everything is smoothed) may create a situation where **every activity becomes critical**, which increases the risk of project delay.

### e. **Using Software**:
- Manually leveling resources can be complex for large projects.
- Project management software helps automate the process by adjusting tasks with the most slack, minimizing the impact on the schedule.

---

## 4. **Resource-Constrained Projects**

In resource-constrained projects, the primary challenge is managing the project within fixed resource limits.

### a. **Problem Definition**:
- Resources (e.g., workers, machinery) are limited and **cannot be increased**.
- When resources are unavailable, **delays are acceptable**, but the goal is to minimize the delay as much as possible.

### b. **Challenges**:
- **Combinatorial problem**: In large projects with many tasks and resource types, there are many possible ways to allocate resources, making manual scheduling impractical.
- **Mathematical methods** (e.g., linear programming) are not suitable for large projects due to complexity.

### c. **Solution: Heuristics**
- **Heuristics** are simple rules of thumb used to make decisions in complex scheduling problems.
- They are not guaranteed to provide the **optimal solution**, but they can produce a **good solution** for complex projects with many resource types.

---

## 5. **Heuristic Methods for Resource-Constrained Projects**

### a. **Parallel Method (Most Common Heuristic)**

- The parallel method helps allocate resources by following a set of priority rules.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Start from the beginning** of the project.
  2. **Apply priority rules** when available resources are exceeded, and delays occur.
  3. **Priority rules**:
     - **Minimum slack**: Prioritize tasks with the least amount of slack (time buffer).
     - **Smallest duration**: If slack is the same, choose the task that takes the least time to complete.
     - **Lowest activity ID**: If slack and duration are the same, choose the task with the lowest ID number.

### b. **Procedure**:
- When resources are exhausted, **delay** tasks that are not critical (those with slack) and **prioritize** those that are.
- The scheduling will be updated in **each period** to reflect changes in early start times and slack.

---

## 6. **Example: Programmer Allocation Scenario**

- **Resource limit**: Only **3 programmers** are available.
- The project duration increases from **12 time units** (in the time-constrained schedule) to **14 time units** (due to resource constraints).
- **Key observations**:
  - Slack for activities is **reduced** as resources are allocated to priority tasks.
  - The number of **critical activities** increases (more activities become dependent on the limited resources).

This example highlights the challenge of balancing resources within a fixed limit and the resulting risks to the project schedule.

---

## 7. **Key Takeaways**:
- Properly classifying the project as **time-constrained** or **resource-constrained** is essential for effective scheduling.
- **Resource leveling** helps smooth out resource demand in time-constrained projects.
- **Heuristic methods**, like the **parallel method**, provide practical solutions for resource-constrained projects.
- **Project management software** plays a vital role in handling complex scheduling problems and automating many of the decision-making processes.

# Splitting Activities

---

## 1. **What is Splitting Activities?**

**Splitting** is a scheduling technique where continuous work in an activity is interrupted, and the resource (e.g., worker, equipment) is temporarily reassigned to another task. After a period of time, the resource returns to finish the original activity. The purpose is to optimize project schedules and increase resource utilization by allowing resources to work on other activities during downtime.

### Example of Splitting:
- Activity **A** is initially scheduled to be worked on continuously.
- However, the resource is sent to work on activity **B** for a while, and then returns to finish activity **A**.
- The original activity **A** is "split" into three parts: **A**, **B**, and **C**, with downtime between them.

---

## 2. **When is Splitting Useful?**

Splitting can be beneficial in the following cases:
- **Low start-up and shutdown costs**: When the time or cost to restart or stop the task is minimal, splitting can help maximize resource use.
  - Example: Moving equipment between tasks where reinitialization is quick and inexpensive.
  
However, splitting is not always suitable and should be used cautiously, especially when **human resources** (e.g., workers) are involved. For tasks requiring cognitive effort or deep focus, the cost of switching between tasks can be significant.

---

## 3. **Challenges of Splitting Activities**

### a. **High Start-up and Shutdown Costs**
- **People work** (e.g., designers, engineers) involves significant conceptual or cognitive switching costs.
  - Example: A designer switching between projects may lose significant time and productivity due to the mental shift between different tasks.
- These costs can result in hidden delays, as workers may lose time when moving from one task to another.
- The total time to complete the original activity may increase due to frequent interruptions.

### b. **Impact on Schedule**
- Splitting tasks can **lengthen the total time** of an activity, even if the resource is used more efficiently during the interruptions.
- **Work is fragmented**, which may lead to inefficiency, especially if the start-up/shutdown time is significant.

---

## 4. **Common Mistakes with Splitting**

- **Overuse of splitting**: Some planners may attempt to resolve resource shortages by splitting tasks too frequently, resulting in the project not being completed on schedule.
- **Underestimating hidden costs**: The costs associated with mental shifts and reorientation when workers switch between tasks are often overlooked, leading to an inaccurate project schedule.

---

## 5. **Best Practices for Using Splitting**

- **Use sparingly**: Splitting should be used only when absolutely necessary and when the costs of restarting the task are minimal.
- **Avoid splitting "people work"**: Tasks that require mental effort or conceptual thinking should not be split, as the hidden costs of switching between tasks are high.
- **Evaluate splitting costs**: Before splitting tasks, assess whether the benefits of improved resource utilization outweigh the costs of interruptions.

---

## 6. **Software Considerations**
- **Splitting option in software**: Modern project management software may offer an option to split activities, but it should be used cautiously.
  - **Careful selection of when to split** is necessary to avoid creating a schedule that is unrealistic or inefficient.

---

## 7. **Conclusion**
While splitting can help address resource constraints and optimize scheduling, it should only be used in specific situations where the benefits outweigh the hidden costs, especially for tasks that involve people or cognitive work. Overuse of splitting can lead to scheduling problems and project delays.

# Benefits of Scheduling Resources & Assigning Project Work

---

## PART 1: **Benefits of Scheduling Resources**

---

### 1. **Why Schedule Resources?**

- When **resources are limited** and **activity durations are accurate**, the **actual (realistic)** project schedule will be **resource-constrained** (not time-constrained).
- Failing to schedule limited resources properly can lead to:
  - Project delays
  - Mismanagement of resources
  - Missed deadlines

---

### 2. **Advantages of Creating a Resource-Constrained Schedule Early**

- **Provides time to explore alternatives** if the schedule is not acceptable.
  - Consider **cost-time trade-offs**
  - Reassess **project priorities**
  - Question the assumption of being “resource-constrained”
  
- **Improves decision-making before project execution begins**

---

### 3. **Helps in Preparing Time-Phased Budgets**

- A resource schedule allows the project manager to:
  - Prepare **detailed budgets** tied to time-specific work packages.
  - Monitor financial and resource usage over time.

---

### 4. **Allows for Quick Response to Unforeseen Events**

Examples of unforeseen events:
- **Employee turnover**
- **Equipment breakdown**
- **Personnel transfers**

With a resource schedule, project managers can quickly evaluate how these affect the project and adapt accordingly.

---

### 5. **Determining Resource Flexibility**

- Project managers can assess how flexible each resource assignment is.
- Helps when:
  - **Other managers request to borrow/share resources**
  - **Negotiating resource sharing**
  - **Building goodwill** ("IOUs") that can help in future cooperation

---

## PART 2: **Assigning Project Work**

---

### 1. **Matching Work to People**

- Match **task requirements** with the **skills and experience** of team members.
- Common strategy: Assign tough tasks to the best people — but beware!

---

### 2. **Avoid Overusing Top Performers**

- Constantly assigning difficult tasks to top talent can lead to:
  - **Resentment** from those individuals
  - **Demotivation** of less-experienced members (lack of learning opportunity)

**Goal:** Balance performance and **employee development**.

---

### 3. **Deciding Who Works With Whom**

Several factors influence this decision:

#### a. **Compatibility & Complementarity**
- Pair people with:
  - **Compatible work habits and personalities**
  - **Complementary strengths and weaknesses**
    - Example: A creative but disorganized person paired with a detail-oriented teammate

#### b. **Experience Mix**
- Team **veterans with new hires**
  - Veterans share knowledge and norms
  - Helps socialize newcomers into the organization

#### c. **Future Collaboration**
- If people need to work together **later in the project**, it’s smart to have them collaborate **early on**.
  - Builds familiarity and teamwork ahead of time

---

### 4. **Conclusion**

- Resource scheduling is essential to avoid problems caused by constraints.
- Smart resource planning allows managers to create accurate budgets, prepare for unexpected issues, and make better staffing decisions.
- Assigning work and building teams should balance **performance, growth**, and **team compatibility**.

# **Multiproject Resource Schedules**

---

## Overview

In reality, organizations rarely manage just one project at a time. They usually operate in a **multiproject environment**, where:

- Several projects are **running simultaneously**
- Each project may share **common resources**
- Priorities, risks, and schedules vary

The **goal** is to develop systems that **efficiently allocate and schedule resources** across all active and upcoming projects.

---

## Key Challenges in Multiproject Resource Scheduling

These are **magnified versions** of single-project problems:

---

### 1. **Overall Schedule Slippage**

- **Shared resources** mean a **delay in one project** can **delay others**.
- Example: Coders working on Project A can’t start on Project B on time, delaying both.

---

### 2. **Inefficient Resource Utilization**

- Different projects require resources at **different times**, causing:
  - **Underutilization** in some periods
  - **Overstaffing** to meet **peak demand**
- Example: A company hires 10 electricians to meet occasional peak demand, even though only 5 are needed regularly.

---

### 3. **Resource Bottlenecks**

- Some resources (equipment or skilled staff) are **limited but essential**.
- Delays occur when **multiple projects need the same resource**.
- Examples:
  - Only one testing device for multiple teams
  - Only one silviculturist (tree scientist) at a forest service location

---

## Strategies to Manage Multiproject Resources

---

### 1. **Central Project Office / Department**

- Oversees resource scheduling across all projects
- Coordinates between teams and manages **resource conflicts**

---

### 2. **First Come–First Served (FCFS) Rule**

- Projects already underway get priority
- New projects are **queued** based on **available resources**
- Useful when:
  - Penalties for delays are high (e.g., contracts)

**Downside:** Doesn’t always use resources efficiently or reflect project priorities.

---

### 3. **Integrated Scheduling Approach ("Megaproject")**

- Treat all projects as part of **one large project**
- Apply standard scheduling **heuristics** (rules of thumb) across all tasks
- Allows:
  - Centralized tracking
  - Easier **bottleneck detection**
  - Prioritized resource assignment using software

---

### 4. **Software with Resource Prioritization Features**

- Allows assigning **priority numbers** to projects (e.g., 1 = top priority)
- Higher priority projects get resources **first**, overriding default heuristics
- Fits well with **project priority models** (Chapter 2)

---

### 5. **Outsourcing**

To handle resource shortages or scheduling pressure, companies may:

- **Outsource non-core projects** to external contractors
- **Outsource specific segments** of a project (e.g., design or testing)
- **Hire temporary workers** during peak periods
- Focus internal efforts only on **core/strategic projects**

**Benefit:** Greater flexibility to manage **high/low activity periods**

---

## Summary

Multiproject resource scheduling is more complex but essential for modern organizations. Key tools and strategies include:

- **Centralized oversight**
- **Software-based priority allocation**
- **Dynamic queues**
- **Outsourcing for flexibility**

These approaches help **minimize delays**, **balance workloads**, and **optimize resource usage** across multiple ongoing projects.

# **Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline**

---

## Purpose

The goal is to create a **time-phased budget baseline** using the resource schedule and WBS. This baseline is **critical** for:

- Monitoring **project progress**
- Tracking **cost and schedule variances**
- Generating **cash flow statements**
- Ensuring **reliable cost control**

---

## Why Time-Phasing Is Necessary

A **time-phased budget** distributes planned costs across the project timeline based on scheduled work. Without it, you **cannot assess** whether you're on **budget or schedule**.

### Example:

Project cost = $4 million  
Timeline = 10 weeks  
Expected spend = $400,000/week

---

| Scenario | Planned Cost (5 weeks) | Actual Cost | Can We Assess Performance?          |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1        | $2,000,000             | $2,400,000  | No — could be ahead of schedule     |
| 2        | $2,000,000             | $1,700,000  | No — could be behind or underworked |

🔍 Without time-phased budgets **tied to work completed**, cost-only comparisons are misleading.

---

## Creating a Time-Phased Budget Baseline

The **baseline** is built by time-phasing costs from work packages in the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** using the **resource schedule**.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Start with WBS/OBS Matrix**:
   - Cross-reference of **deliverables** and **responsible units**
   - Each intersection = **Control Account** (total cost for a specific deliverable/org unit)

2. **Roll-Up Totals**:
   - Column total = **Deliverable budget**
   - Row total = **Department budget**

3. **Time-Phase Work Packages**:
   - Distribute costs according to expected work over time
   - Done for each **labor, material, and equipment** component

---

### Example:

**Work Package Duration** = 3 weeks  
**Labor Costs**:

- Week 1 = $40,000  
- Week 2 = $30,000  
- Week 3 = $50,000

➡️ Placed in the project schedule to form the **Time-Phased Budget**.

---

### When Activities Contain Multiple Work Packages

- Consolidate multiple WPs into a single activity
- Distribute costs across the activity’s scheduled duration

**Example**:

| Week | WP (Code) | WP (Integration) | Total   |
| ---- | --------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 1    | $20,000   | —                | $20,000 |
| 2    | $15,000   | —                | $15,000 |
| 3    | $40,000   | $35,000          | $75,000 |
| 4    | —         | $70,000          | $70,000 |

---

## Result: **Project Cost Baseline**

Also called **Planned Value (PV)**

- Used in **Earned Value Management (EVM)** to:
  - Measure performance
  - Calculate schedule/cost variances

---

## Additional Outputs

Once the cost baseline is developed:

1. **Cash Flow Statements**:
   - Helps firms ensure funding is available throughout the project

2. **Resource Usage Schedules**:
   - Maps deployment of personnel and equipment
   - Used to develop individual work schedules

---

## Summary

- A **time-phased budget baseline** integrates **schedule and cost**.
- It allows for **real performance tracking** and supports **project control systems** like Earned Value.
- This baseline is derived from:
  - **WBS**
  - **Resource assignments**
  - **Scheduled activities**

This forms the **foundation** for measuring project success in execution.
